25. They trespassed against the God of their fathers, and played the prostitute after the gods of the peoples of the land whom God destroyed before them. 
26. So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath Pilneser king of Assyria, and he carried away the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and to the river of Gozan, to this day.

1. So all Israel were listed by genealogies; and behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel. Judah was carried away captive to Babylon for their disobedience. 
2. Now the first inhabitants who lived in their possessions in their cities were Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the temple servants.

17. The gatekeepers: Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brothers (Shallum was the chief), 
18. who previously served in the king’s gate eastward. They were the gatekeepers for the camp of the children of Levi. 
19. Shallum was the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brothers, of his father’s house, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the thresholds of the tent. Their fathers had been over Yahweh’s camp, keepers of the entry. 
20. Phinehas the son of Eleazar was ruler over them in time past, and Yahweh was with him. 
21. Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper of the door of the Tent of Meeting. 
22. All these who were chosen to be gatekeepers in the thresholds were two hundred twelve. These were listed by genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer ordained in their office of trust. 
23. So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of Yahweh’s house, even the house of the tent, as guards. 
24. On the four sides were the gatekeepers, toward the east, west, north, and south. 
25. Their brothers, in their villages, were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them, 
26. for the four chief gatekeepers, who were Levites, were in an office of trust, and were over the rooms and over the treasuries in God’s house. 
27. They stayed around God’s house, because that was their duty; and it was their duty to open it morning by morning.

29. Some of them also were appointed over the furniture, and over all the vessels of the sanctuary, over the fine flour, the wine, the oil, the frankincense, and the spices.

33. These are the singers, heads of fathers’ households of the Levites, who lived in the rooms and were free from other service, for they were employed in their work day and night.

** 10 

1. Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain on Mount Gilboa. 
2. The Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. 
3. The battle went hard against Saul, and the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the archers. 
4. Then Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me.” 
 But his armor bearer would not, for he was terrified. Therefore Saul took his sword and fell on it. 
5. When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword and died. 
6. So Saul died with his three sons; and all his house died together. 
7. When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them. 

8. On the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
9. They stripped him and took his head and his armor, then sent into the land of the Philistines all around to carry the news to their idols and to the people. 
10. They put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon. 
11. When all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, 
12. all the valiant men arose and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. 

13. So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against Yahweh, because of Yahweh’s word, which he didn’t keep, and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit, to inquire, 
14. and didn’t inquire of Yahweh. Therefore he killed him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse. 
** 11 

1. Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh. 
2. In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. Yahweh your God said to you, ‘You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.’” 

3. So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh. They anointed David king over Israel, according to Yahweh’s word by Samuel. 

4. David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (also called Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were there. 
5. The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not come in here!” Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. The same is David’s city. 
6. David had said, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.” Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief. 
7. David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it David’s city. 
8. He built the city all around, from Millo even around; and Joab repaired the rest of the city. 
9. David grew greater and greater, for Yahweh of Armies was with him. 

10. Now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to Yahweh’s word concerning Israel. 

11. This is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time. 
12. After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men. 
13. He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. 
14. They stood in the middle of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and Yahweh saved them by a great victory. 

15. Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 
16. David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem at that time. 
17. David longed, and said, “Oh, that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!” 

18. The three broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate, took it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink any of it, but poured it out to Yahweh, 
19. and said, “My God forbid me, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their lives in jeopardy?” For they risked their lives to bring it. Therefore he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things. 

20. Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them, and had a name among the three. 
21. Of the three, he was more honorable than the two, and was made their captain; however he wasn’t included in the three. 

22. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day. 
23. He killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high. In the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and killed him with his own spear. 
24. Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these things and had a name among the three mighty men. 
25. Behold, he was more honorable than the thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three; and David set him over his guard. 

26. The mighty men of the armies also include Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 
27. Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, 
28. Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, 
29. Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 
30. Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, 
31. Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 
32. Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 
33. Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 
34. the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shagee the Hararite, 
35. Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, 
36. Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 
37. Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, 
38. Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri, 
39. Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite (the armor bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah), 
40. Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
41. Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, 
42. Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite (a chief of the Reubenites), and thirty with him, 
43. Hanan the son of Maacah, Joshaphat the Mithnite, 
44. Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite, 
45. Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite, 
46. Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite, 
47. Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite. 
** 12 

1. Now these are those who came to David to Ziklag while he was a fugitive from Saul the son of Kish. They were among the mighty men, his helpers in war. 
2. They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting arrows from the bow. They were of Saul’s relatives of the tribe of Benjamin. 
3. The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah; Jehu the Anathothite; 
4. Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty and a leader of the thirty; Jeremiah; Jahaziel; Johanan; Jozabad the Gederathite; 
5. Eluzai; Jerimoth; Bealiah; Shemariah; Shephatiah the Haruphite; 
6. Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites; 
7. and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. 

8. Some Gadites joined David in the stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valor, men trained for war, who could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as the gazelles on the mountains: 
9. Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 
10. Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, 
11. Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, 
12. Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 
13. Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbannai the eleventh. 
14. These of the sons of Gad were captains of the army. He who was least was equal to one hundred, and the greatest to one thousand. 
15. These are those who went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its banks; and they put to flight all who lived in the valleys, both toward the east and toward the west. 

16. Some of the children of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David. 
17. David went out to meet them, and answered them, “If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be united with you; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers see this and rebuke it.” 
18. Then the Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and he said, “We are yours, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse. Peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you.” Then David received them and made them captains of the band. 

19. Some of Manasseh also joined David when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle, but they didn’t help them, for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after consultation, saying, “He will desert to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.” 

20. As he went to Ziklag, some from Manasseh joined him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of Manasseh. 
21. They helped David against the band of raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor and were captains in the army. 
22. For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great army, like God’s army. 

23. These are the numbers of the heads of those who were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to Yahweh’s word. 
24. The children of Judah who bore shield and spear were six thousand eight hundred, armed for war. 
25. Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valor for the war: seven thousand one hundred. 
26. Of the children of Levi: four thousand six hundred. 
27. Jehoiada was the leader of the household of Aaron; and with him were three thousand seven hundred, 
28. and Zadok, a young man mighty of valor, and of his father’s house twenty-two captains. 
29. Of the children of Benjamin, Saul’s relatives: three thousand, for until then, the greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to Saul’s house. 
30. Of the children of Ephraim: twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valor, famous men in their fathers’ houses. 
31. Of the half-tribe of Manasseh: eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and make David king. 
32. Of the children of Issachar, men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do, their heads were two hundred; and all their brothers were at their command. 
33. Of Zebulun, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array with all kinds of instruments of war: fifty thousand who could command and were not of double heart. 
34. Of Naphtali: one thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty-seven thousand. 
35. Of the Danites who could set the battle in array: twenty-eight thousand six hundred. 
36. Of Asher, such as were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array: forty thousand. 
37. On the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites, the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle: one hundred twenty thousand. 

38. All these were men of war who could order the battle array, and came with a perfect heart to Hebron to make David king over all Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king. 
39. They were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their brothers had supplied provisions for them. 
40. Moreover those who were near to them, as far as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, on camels, on mules, and on oxen: supplies of flour, cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, wine, oil, cattle, and sheep in abundance; for there was joy in Israel. 
** 13 

1. David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader. 
2. David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if it is of Yahweh our God, let’s send word everywhere to our brothers who are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have pasture lands, that they may gather themselves to us. 
3. Also, let’s bring the ark of our God back to us again, for we didn’t seek it in the days of Saul.” 

4. All the assembly said that they would do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. 
5. So David assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor River of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, to bring God’s ark from Kiriath Jearim. 

6. David went up with all Israel to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there God Yahweh’s ark that sits above the cherubim, that is called by the Name. 
7. They carried God’s ark on a new cart, and brought it out of Abinadab’s house; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart. 
8. David and all Israel played before God with all their might, even with songs, with harps, with stringed instruments, with tambourines, with cymbals, and with trumpets. 

9. When they came to Chidon’s threshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled. 
10. Yahweh’s anger burned against Uzza, and he struck him because he put his hand on the ark; and he died there before God. 
11. David was displeased, because Yahweh had broken out against Uzza. He called that place Perez Uzza, to this day. 
12. David was afraid of God that day, saying, “How can I bring God’s ark home to me?” 
13. So David didn’t move the ark with him into David’s city, but carried it aside into Obed-Edom the Gittite’s house. 
14. God’s ark remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months; and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom’s house and all that he had. 
** 14 

1. Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, masons, and carpenters, to build him a house. 
2. David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel, for his kingdom was highly exalted, for his people Israel’s sake. 

3. David took more wives in Jerusalem, and David became the father of more sons and daughters. 
4. These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
5. Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
6. Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
7. Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet. 

8. When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went out against them. 
9. Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim. 
10. David inquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?” 
 Yahweh said to him, “Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.” 

11. So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David defeated them there. David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like waters breaking out. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim. 
12. They left their gods there; and David gave a command, and they were burned with fire. 

13. The Philistines made another raid in the valley. 
14. David inquired again of God; and God said to him, “You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come on them opposite the mulberry trees. 
15. When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.” 

16. David did as God commanded him; and they attacked the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer. 
17. The fame of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations. 
** 15 

1. David made himself houses in David’s city; and he prepared a place for God’s ark, and pitched a tent for it. 
2. Then David said, “No one ought to carry God’s ark but the Levites. For Yahweh has chosen them to carry God’s ark, and to minister to him forever.” 

3. David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up Yahweh’s ark to its place, which he had prepared for it. 
4. David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites: 
5. of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers one hundred twenty; 
6. of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred twenty; 
7. of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers one hundred thirty; 
8. of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred; 
9. of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers eighty; 
10. of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers one hundred twelve. 

11. David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites: for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab, 
12. and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, up to the place that I have prepared for it. 
13. For because you didn’t carry it at first, Yahweh our God broke out in anger against us, because we didn’t seek him according to the ordinance.” 

14. So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
15. The children of the Levites bore God’s ark on their shoulders with its poles, as Moses commanded according to Yahweh’s word. 

16. David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers with instruments of music, stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up their voices with joy. 
17. So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 
18. and with them their brothers of the second rank: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers. 
19. So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were given cymbals of bronze to sound aloud; 
20. and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth; 
21. and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed lyre, to lead. 
22. Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the singing. He taught the singers, because he was skillful. 
23. Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark. 
24. Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before God’s ark; and Obed-Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark. 

25. So David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands went to bring the ark of Yahweh’s covenant up out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy. 
26. When God helped the Levites who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. 
27. David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the choir master with the singers; and David had an ephod of linen on him. 
28. Thus all Israel brought the ark of Yahweh’s covenant up with shouting, with sound of the cornet, with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps. 
29. As the ark of Yahweh’s covenant came to David’s city, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart. 
** 16 

1. They brought in God’s ark, and set it in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God. 
2. When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in Yahweh’s name. 
3. He gave to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. 

4. He appointed some of the Levites to minister before Yahweh’s ark, and to commemorate, to thank, and to praise Yahweh, the God of Israel: 
5. Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with stringed instruments and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud; 
6. with Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God. 

7. Then on that day David first ordained giving of thanks to Yahweh by the hand of Asaph and his brothers. 
8. Oh give thanks to Yahweh.

** 17 

1. When David was living in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I live in a cedar house, but the ark of Yahweh’s covenant is in a tent.” 

2. Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.” 

3. That same night, the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 
4. “Go and tell David my servant, ‘Yahweh says, “You shall not build me a house to dwell in; 
5. for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tent to another. 
6. In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’”’ 

7. “Now therefore, you shall tell my servant David, ‘Yahweh of Armies says, “I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel. 
8. I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth. 
9. I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. The children of wickedness will not waste them any more, as at the first, 
10. and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house. 
11. It will happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your offspring after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom. 
12. He will build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. 
13. I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from him who was before you; 
14. but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever. His throne will be established forever.”’” 
15. According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David. 

16. Then David the king went in and sat before Yahweh; and he said, “Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you have brought me this far? 
17. This was a small thing in your eyes, O God, but you have spoken of your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have respected me according to the standard of a man of high degree, Yahweh God. 
18. What can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? For you know your servant. 
19. Yahweh, for your servant’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness, to make known all these great things. 
20. Yahweh, there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 
21. What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people whom you redeemed out of Egypt? 
22. For you made your people Israel your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God. 
23. Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken. 
24. Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.’ 
25. For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you. 
26. Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant. 
27. Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.”

1. After this, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines. 
2. He defeated Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute. 

3. David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah, toward Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates. 
4. David took from him one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them enough for one hundred chariots. 
5. When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck twenty-two thousand men of the Syrians. 
6. Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David and brought tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went. 
7. David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
8. From Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea, the pillars, and the vessels of bronze. 

9. When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, 
10. he sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet him and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou); and he had with him all kinds of vessels of gold and silver and bronze. 
11. King David also dedicated these to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations: from Edom, from Moab, from the children of Ammon, from the Philistines, and from Amalek. 

12. Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck eighteen thousand of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 
13. He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went. 

14. David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness for all his people. 
15. Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; 
16. Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was scribe; 
17. and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief officials serving the king. 
** 19 

1. After this, Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place. 
2. David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.” 
 So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun to comfort him. 
3. But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven’t his servants come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?” 
4. So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle at their buttocks, and sent them away. 
5. Then some people went and told David how the men were treated. He sent to meet them; for the men were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.” 

6. When the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah. 
7. So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah with his people, who came and encamped near Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. 
8. When David heard of it, he sent Joab with all the army of the mighty men. 
9. The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city; and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field. 

10. Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose some of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians. 
11. The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon. 
12. He said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you are to help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you. 
13. Be courageous, and let’s be strong for our people and for the cities of our God. May Yahweh do that which seems good to him.” 

14. So Joab and the people who were with him came near to the front of the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him. 
15. When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. 

16. When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and called out the Syrians who were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer leading them. 
17. David was told that, so he gathered all Israel together, passed over the Jordan, came to them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. 
18. The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed of the Syrian men seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand footmen, and also killed Shophach the captain of the army. 
19. When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and served him. The Syrians would not help the children of Ammon any more. 
** 20 

1. At the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, Joab led out the army and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it. 
2. David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it. It was set on David’s head, and he brought very much plunder out of the city. 
3. He brought out the people who were in it, and had them cut with saws, with iron picks, and with axes. David did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. 

4. After this, war arose at Gezer with the Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued. 

5. Again there was war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. 
6. There was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand and six on each foot; and he also was born to the giant. 
7. When he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him. 
8. These were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants. 
** 21 

1. Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to take a census of Israel. 
2. David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know how many there are.” 

3. Joab said, “May Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?” 

4. Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel, then came to Jerusalem. 
5. Joab gave the sum of the census of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew a sword; and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew a sword. 
6. But he didn’t count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s word was abominable to Joab. 

7. God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel. 
8. David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant, for I have done very foolishly.” 

9. Yahweh spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying, 
10. “Go and speak to David, saying, ‘Yahweh says, “I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.”’” 

11. So Gad came to David and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Take your choice: 
12. either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days of the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and Yahweh’s angel destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.’” 

13. David said to Gad, “I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into Yahweh’s hand, for his mercies are very great. Don’t let me fall into man’s hand.” 

14. So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell. 
15. God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, “It is enough. Now withdraw your hand.” Yahweh’s angel was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
16. David lifted up his eyes, and saw Yahweh’s angel standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. 
 Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces. 
17. David said to God, “Isn’t it I who commanded the people to be counted? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me and against my father’s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.” 

18. Then Yahweh’s angel commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise an altar to Yahweh on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
19. David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in Yahweh’s name. 

20. Ornan turned back and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. 
21. As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. 

22. Then David said to Ornan, “Sell me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to Yahweh on it. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.” 

23. Ornan said to David, “Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.” 

24. King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing.” 

25. So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place. 
26. David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering. 

27. Then Yahweh commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath. 

28. At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. 
29. For Yahweh’s tabernacle, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon. 
30. But David couldn’t go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid because of the sword of Yahweh’s angel. 
** 22 

1. Then David said, “This is the house of Yahweh God, and this is the altar of burnt offering for Israel.” 

2. David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to cut dressed stones to build God’s house. 
3. David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the couplings, and bronze in abundance without weight, 
4. and cedar trees without number, for the Sidonians and the people of Tyre brought cedar trees in abundance to David. 
5. David said, “Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built for Yahweh must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries. I will therefore make preparation for it.” So David prepared abundantly before his death. 
6. Then he called for Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
7. David said to Solomon his son, “As for me, it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Yahweh my God. 
8. But Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, ‘You have shed blood abundantly and have made great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight. 
9. Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of peace. I will give him rest from all his enemies all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days. 
10. He shall build a house for my name; and he will be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’ 
11. Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you and prosper you, and build the house of Yahweh your God, as he has spoken concerning you. 
12. May Yahweh give you discretion and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel, so that you may keep the law of Yahweh your God. 
13. Then you will prosper, if you observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid and don’t be dismayed. 
14. Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for Yahweh’s house one hundred thousand talents of gold, one million talents of silver, and bronze and iron without weight; for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and stone; and you may add to them. 
15. There are also workmen with you in abundance—cutters and workers of stone and timber, and all kinds of men who are skillful in every kind of work; 
16. of the gold, the silver, the bronze, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may Yahweh be with you.” 

17. David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, 
18. “Isn’t Yahweh your God with you? Hasn’t he given you rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Yahweh and before his people. 
19. Now set your heart and your soul to follow Yahweh your God. Arise therefore, and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God, to bring the ark of Yahweh’s covenant and the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for Yahweh’s name.” 
** 23 

1. Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel. 
2. He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. 
3. The Levites were counted from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand. 
4. David said, “Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of Yahweh’s house, six thousand were officers and judges, 
5. four thousand were doorkeepers, and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made for giving praise.” 

6. David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 

7. Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei. 
8. The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, Zetham, and Joel, three. 
9. The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’ households of Ladan. 
10. The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. 
11. Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah didn’t have many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning. 

12. The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 
13. The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to minister to him, and to bless in his name forever. 
14. But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi. 
15. The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. 
16. The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief. 
17. The son of Eliezer was Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. 
18. The son of Izhar: Shelomith the chief. 
19. The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 
20. The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second. 

21. The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish. 
22. Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only; and their relatives, the sons of Kish, took them as wives. 
23. The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three. 

24. These were the sons of Levi after their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ houses of those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of Yahweh’s house, from twenty years old and upward. 
25. For David said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever. 
26. Also the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.” 
27. For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were counted, from twenty years old and upward. 
28. For their duty was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of Yahweh’s house—in the courts, in the rooms, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of God’s house; 
29. for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all measurements of quantity and size; 
30. and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yahweh, and likewise in the evening; 
31. and to offer all burnt offerings to Yahweh on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Yahweh; 
32. and that they should keep the duty of the Tent of Meeting, the duty of the holy place, and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers for the service of Yahweh’s house. 
** 24 

1. These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
2. But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children; therefore Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests. 
3. David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service. 
4. There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and they were divided like this: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers’ houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers’ houses, eight. 
5. Thus they were divided impartially by drawing lots; for there were princes of the sanctuary and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. 
6. Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers’ house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar. 

7. Now the first lot came out to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, 
8. the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 
9. the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 
10. the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, 
11. the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, 
12. the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 
13. the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, 
14. the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, 
15. the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez, 
16. the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel, 
17. the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul, 
18. the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah. 
19. This was their ordering in their service, to come into Yahweh’s house according to the ordinance given to them by Aaron their father, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, had commanded him. 

20. Of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah. 
21. Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief. 
22. Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath. 
23. The sons of Hebron: Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 
24. The sons of Uzziel: Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir. 
25. The brother of Micah: Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah. 
26. The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The son of Jaaziah: Beno. 
27. The sons of Merari by Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri. 
28. Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. 
29. Of Kish, the son of Kish: Jerahmeel. 
30. The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers’ houses. 
31. These likewise cast lots even as their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the priests and of the Levites, the fathers’ households of the chief even as those of his younger brother. 
** 25 

1. Moreover, David and the captains of the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who were to prophesy with harps, with stringed instruments, and with cymbals. The number of those who did the work according to their service was: 
2. of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah. The sons of Asaph were under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied at the order of the king. 
3. Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Yahweh with the harp. 
4. Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth. 
5. All these were the sons of Heman the king’s seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. 
6. All these were under the hands of their father for song in Yahweh’s house, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps, for the service of God’s house: Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman being under the order of the king. 
7. The number of them, with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Yahweh, even all who were skillful, was two hundred eighty-eight. 
8. They cast lots for their offices, all alike, the small as well as the great, the teacher as well as the student. 

9. Now the first lot came out for Asaph to Joseph; the second to Gedaliah, he and his brothers and sons were twelve; 
10. the third to Zaccur, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 
11. the fourth to Izri, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 
12. the fifth to Nethaniah, his sons and his brothers, twelve;

19. the twelfth to Hashabiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 
20. for the thirteenth, Shubael, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 
21. for the fourteenth, Mattithiah, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 
22. for the fifteenth to Jeremoth, his sons and his brothers, twelve;

27. for the twentieth to Eliathah, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 
28. for the twenty-first to Hothir, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 
29. for the twenty-second to Giddalti, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 
30. for the twenty-third to Mahazioth, his sons and his brothers, twelve; 
31. for the twenty-fourth to Romamti-Ezer, his sons and his brothers, twelve. 
** 26 

1. For the divisions of the doorkeepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph. 
2. Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth, 
3. Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, and Eliehoenai the seventh. 
4. Obed-Edom had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sacar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth, 
5. Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, and Peullethai the eighth; for God blessed him. 
6. Sons were also born to Shemaiah his son, who ruled over the house of their father; for they were mighty men of valor. 
7. The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose relatives were valiant men, Elihu, and Semachiah. 
8. All these were of the sons of Obed-Edom with their sons and their brothers, able men in strength for the service: sixty-two of Obed-Edom. 
9. Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, eighteen valiant men. 
10. Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him chief), 
11. Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, and Zechariah the fourth. All the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen. 

12. Of these were the divisions of the doorkeepers, even of the chief men, having offices like their brothers, to minister in Yahweh’s house. 
13. They cast lots, the small as well as the great, according to their fathers’ houses, for every gate. 
14. The lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counselor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward. 
15. To Obed-Edom southward; and to his sons the storehouse. 
16. To Shuppim and Hosah westward, by the gate of Shallecheth, at the causeway that goes up, watchman opposite watchman. 
17. Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and for the storehouse two and two. 
18. For Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar. 
19. These were the divisions of the doorkeepers; of the sons of the Korahites, and of the sons of Merari. 

20. Of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of God’s house and over the treasures of the dedicated things. 
21. The sons of Ladan, the sons of the Gershonites belonging to Ladan, the heads of the fathers’ households belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli. 
22. The sons of Jehieli: Zetham, and Joel his brother, over the treasures of Yahweh’s house. 
23. Of the Amramites, of the Izharites, of the Hebronites, of the Uzzielites: 
24. Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler over the treasuries. 
25. His brothers: of Eliezer, Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son. 
26. This Shelomoth and his brothers were over all the treasuries of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the heads of the fathers’ households, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the army, had dedicated. 
27. They dedicated some of the plunder won in battles to repair Yahweh’s house. 
28. All that Samuel the seer, Saul the son of Kish, Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah had dedicated, whoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomoth and of his brothers. 

29. Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were appointed to the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges. 
30. Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, one thousand seven hundred men of valor, had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward, for all the business of Yahweh and for the service of the king. 
31. Of the Hebronites, Jerijah was the chief of the Hebronites, according to their generations by fathers’ households. They were sought for in the fortieth year of the reign of David, and mighty men of valor were found among them at Jazer of Gilead. 
32. His relatives, men of valor, were two thousand seven hundred, heads of fathers’ households, whom King David made overseers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites, for every matter pertaining to God and for the affairs of the king. 
** 27 

1. Now the children of Israel after their number, the heads of fathers’ households and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and their officers who served the king in any matter of the divisions which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year—of every division were twenty-four thousand. 

2. Over the first division for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel. In his division were twenty-four thousand. 
3. He was of the children of Perez, the chief of all the captains of the army for the first month. 
4. Over the division of the second month was Dodai the Ahohite and his division, and Mikloth the ruler; and in his division were twenty-four thousand. 
5. The third captain of the army for the third month was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the chief priest. In his division were twenty-four thousand. 
6. This is that Benaiah who was the mighty man of the thirty and over the thirty. Of his division was Ammizabad his son.

17. of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel; of Aaron, Zadok;

21. of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah; of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner; 
22. of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the captains of the tribes of Israel. 
23. But David didn’t take the number of them from twenty years old and under, because Yahweh had said he would increase Israel like the stars of the sky. 
24. Joab the son of Zeruiah began to take a census, but didn’t finish; and wrath came on Israel for this. The number wasn’t put into the account in the chronicles of King David. 

25. Over the king’s treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel. Over the treasures in the fields, in the cities, in the villages, and in the towers was Jonathan the son of Uzziah; 
26. Over those who did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub. 
27. Over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite. Over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite.

31. All these were the rulers of the property which was King David’s.

33. Ahithophel was the king’s counselor. Hushai the Archite was the king’s friend. 
34. After Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar. Joab was the captain of the king’s army. 
** 28 

1. David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, the captains of the companies who served the king by division, the captains of thousands, the captains of hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the king and of his sons, with the officers and the mighty men, even all the mighty men of valor, to Jerusalem. 
2. Then David the king stood up on his feet and said, “Hear me, my brothers and my people! As for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, and for the footstool of our God; and I had prepared for the building. 
3. But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war and have shed blood.’ 
4. However Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For he has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel. 
5. Of all my sons (for Yahweh has given me many sons), he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of Yahweh’s kingdom over Israel. 
6. He said to me, ‘Solomon, your son, shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. 
7. I will establish his kingdom forever if he continues to do my commandments and my ordinances, as it is today.’ 

8. Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, Yahweh’s assembly, and in the audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of Yahweh your God, that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you forever. 

9. You, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Yahweh searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever. 
10. Take heed now, for Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong, and do it.” 

11. Then David gave to Solomon his son the plans for the porch of the temple, for its houses, for its treasuries, for its upper rooms, for its inner rooms, for the place of the mercy seat; 
12. and the plans of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of Yahweh’s house, for all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of God’s house, and for the treasuries of the dedicated things; 
13. also for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the work of the service of Yahweh’s house, and for all the vessels of service in Yahweh’s house— 
14. of gold by weight for the gold for all vessels of every kind of service, for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service; 
15. by weight also for the lamp stands of gold, and for its lamps, of gold, by weight for every lamp stand and for its lamps; and for the lamp stands of silver, by weight for every lamp stand and for its lamps, according to the use of every lamp stand; 
16. and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver; 
17. and the forks, the basins, and the cups, of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for the silver bowls by weight for every bowl; 
18. and for the altar of incense, refined gold by weight; and gold for the plans for the chariot, and the cherubim that spread out and cover the ark of Yahweh’s covenant. 
19. “All this”, David said, “I have been made to understand in writing from Yahweh’s hand, even all the works of this pattern.” 

20. David said to Solomon his son, “Be strong and courageous, and do it. Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed, for Yahweh God, even my God, is with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you, until all the work for the service of Yahweh’s house is finished. 
21. Behold, there are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of God’s house. Every willing man who has skill for any kind of service shall be with you in all kinds of work. Also the captains and all the people will be entirely at your command.” 
** 29 

1. David the king said to all the assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Yahweh God. 
2. Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, the bronze for the things of bronze, iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, also onyx stones, stones to be set, stones for inlaid work of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. 
3. In addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house: 
4. even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses; 
5. of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be made by the hands of artisans. Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself today to Yahweh?” 

6. Then the princes of the fathers’ households, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king’s work, offered willingly; 
7. and they gave for the service of God’s house of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, of silver ten thousand talents, of bronze eighteen thousand talents, and of iron one hundred thousand talents. 
8. People with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of Yahweh’s house, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. 
9. Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh; and David the king also rejoiced with great joy. 

10. Therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly; and David said, “You are blessed, Yahweh, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever. 
11. Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty! For all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, Yahweh, and you are exalted as head above all. 
12. Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all! In your hand is power and might! It is in your hand to make great, and to give strength to all! 
13. Now therefore, our God, we thank you and praise your glorious name. 
14. But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from you, and we have given you of your own. 
15. For we are strangers before you and foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no remaining. 
16. Yahweh our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand, and is all your own. 
17. I know also, my God, that you try the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things. Now I have seen with joy your people, who are present here, offer willingly to you. 
18. Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this desire forever in the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart for you; 
19. and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.” 

20. Then David said to all the assembly, “Now bless Yahweh your God!” 
 All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the king. 
21. They sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on the next day after that day, even one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel, 
22. and ate and drank before Yahweh on that day with great gladness. They made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him before Yahweh to be prince, and Zadok to be priest. 

23. Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. 
24. All the princes, the mighty men, and also all of the sons of King David submitted themselves to Solomon the king. 
25. Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and gave to him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel. 

26. Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
27. The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 
28. He died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place. 
29. Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer, 
30. with all his reign and his might, and the events that involved him, Israel, and all the kingdoms of the lands.
** II Chronicles
** 1 

1. Solomon the son of David was firmly established in his kingdom, and Yahweh his God was with him, and made him exceedingly great. 

2. Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ households. 
3. Then Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for God’s Tent of Meeting was there, which Yahweh’s servant Moses had made in the wilderness. 
4. But David had brought God’s ark up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. 
5. Moreover the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was there before Yahweh’s tabernacle; and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there. 
6. Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh, which was at the Tent of Meeting, and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it. 

7. That night, God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask for what you want me to give you.” 

8. Solomon said to God, “You have shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in his place. 
9. Now, Yahweh God, let your promise to David my father be established; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. 
10. Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of yours?” 

11. God said to Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, nor yet have you asked for long life; but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king, 
12. therefore wisdom and knowledge is granted to you. I will give you riches, wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you, and none after you will have.” 

13. So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting, to Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel. 

14. Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. He had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
15. The king made silver and gold to be as common as stones in Jerusalem, and he made cedars to be as common as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland. 
16. The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue. The king’s merchants purchased them from Kue. 
17. They imported from Egypt then exported a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver and a horse for one hundred fifty. They also exported them to the Hittite kings and the Syrian kings. 
** 2 

1. Now Solomon decided to build a house for Yahweh’s name, and a house for his kingdom. 
2. Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, eighty thousand men who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them. 

3. Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, “As you dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build him a house in which to dwell, so deal with me. 
4. Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, to dedicate it to him, to burn before him incense of sweet spices, for the continual show bread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Yahweh our God. This is an ordinance forever to Israel. 

5. “The house which I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all gods. 
6. But who is able to build him a house, since heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain him? Who am I then, that I should build him a house, except just to burn incense before him? 

7. “Now therefore send me a man skillful to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, in iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave engravings, to be with the skillful men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided. 

8. “Send me also cedar trees, cypress trees, and algum trees out of Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. Behold, my servants will be with your servants, 
9. even to prepare me timber in abundance; for the house which I am about to build will be great and wonderful. 
10. Behold, I will give to your servants, the cutters who cut timber, twenty thousand cors of beaten wheat, twenty thousand baths of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.” 

11. Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, “Because Yahweh loves his people, he has made you king over them.” 
12. Huram continued, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endowed with discretion and understanding, who would build a house for Yahweh and a house for his kingdom. 

13. Now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, Huram-abi, 
14. the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan; and his father was a man of Tyre. He is skillful to work in gold, in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stone, in timber, in purple, in blue, in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any kind of engraving and to devise any device, that there may be a place appointed to him with your skillful men, and with the skillful men of my lord David your father. 

15. “Now therefore, the wheat, the barley, the oil, and the wine which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants; 
16. and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as you need. We will bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa; then you shall carry it up to Jerusalem.” 

17. Solomon counted all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, after the census with which David his father had counted them; and they found one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred. 
18. He set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred overseers to assign the people their work. 
** 3 

1. Then Solomon began to build Yahweh’s house at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where Yahweh appeared to David his father, which he prepared in the place that David had appointed, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
2. He began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. 
3. Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God’s house: the length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the width twenty cubits. 
4. The porch that was in front, its length, across the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold. 
5. He made the larger room with a ceiling of cypress wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains. 
6. He decorated the house with precious stones for beauty. The gold was gold from Parvaim. 
7. He also overlaid the house, the beams, the thresholds, its walls, and its doors with gold, and engraved cherubim on the walls. 

8. He made the most holy place. Its length, according to the width of the house, was twenty cubits, and its width twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents. 
9. The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He overlaid the upper rooms with gold. 

10. In the most holy place he made two cherubim by carving, and they overlaid them with gold. 
11. The wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long: the wing of the one was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub. 
12. The wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, joining to the wing of the other cherub. 
13. The wings of these cherubim spread themselves out twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house. 
14. He made the veil of blue, purple, crimson, and fine linen, and ornamented it with cherubim. 

15. Also he made before the house two pillars thirty-five cubits heigh, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits. 
16. He made chains in the inner sanctuary, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains. 
17. He set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz. 
** 4 

1. Then he made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and ten cubits high. 
2. Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim. It was round, five cubits high, and thirty cubits in circumference. 
3. Under it was the likeness of oxen, which encircled it, for ten cubits, encircling the sea. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast. 
4. It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, three looking toward the west, three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set on them above, and all their hindquarters were inward. 
5. It was a handbreadth thick. Its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It received and held three thousand baths. 
6. He also made ten basins, and put five on the right hand and five on the left, to wash in them. The things that belonged to the burnt offering were washed in them, but the sea was for the priests to wash in. 

7. He made the ten lamp stands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them; and he set them in the temple, five on the right hand and five on the left. 
8. He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. He made one hundred basins of gold. 
9. Furthermore he made the court of the priests, the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with bronze. 
10. He set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south. 

11. Huram made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. 
 So Huram finished doing the work that he did for King Solomon in God’s house: 
12. the two pillars, the bowls, the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars, 
13. and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks—two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars. 
14. He also made the bases, and he made the basins on the bases— 
15. one sea, and the twelve oxen under it. 
16. Huram-abi also made the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all its vessels for King Solomon, for Yahweh’s house, of bright bronze. 
17. The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. 
18. Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance, so that the weight of the bronze could not be determined. 

19. Solomon made all the vessels that were in God’s house: the golden altar, the tables with the show bread on them, 
20. and the lamp stands with their lamps to burn according to the ordinance before the inner sanctuary, of pure gold; 
21. and the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs of gold that was purest gold; 
22. and the snuffers, the basins, the spoons, and the fire pans of pure gold. As for the entry of the house, its inner doors for the most holy place and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold. 
** 5 

1. Thus all the work that Solomon did for Yahweh’s house was finished. Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of God’s house. 

2. Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ households of the children of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh’s covenant out of David’s city, which is Zion. 
3. So all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month. 
4. All the elders of Israel came. The Levites took up the ark. 
5. They brought up the ark, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent. The Levitical priests brought these up. 
6. King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel who were assembled to him were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle that could not be counted or numbered for multitude. 
7. The priests brought in the ark of Yahweh’s covenant to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim. 
8. For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above. 
9. The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark in front of the inner sanctuary, but they were not seen outside; and it is there to this day. 
10. There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt. 

11. When the priests had come out of the holy place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, and didn’t keep their divisions; 
12. also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them one hundred twenty priests sounding with trumpets); 
13. when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Yahweh; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Yahweh, saying, 
#+BEGIN_VERSE
    “For he is good, 
      for his loving kindness endures forever!” 
#+END_VERSE
then the house was filled with a cloud, even Yahweh’s house, 
14. so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for Yahweh’s glory filled God’s house. 
** 6 

1. Then Solomon said, “Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. 
2. But I have built you a house and home, a place for you to dwell in forever.” 

3. The king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel; and all the assembly of Israel stood. 

4. He said, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hands fulfilled it, saying, 
5. ‘Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there, and I chose no man to be prince over my people Israel; 
6. but now I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’ 
7. Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
8. But Yahweh said to David my father, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart; 
9. nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who will come out of your body, he shall build the house for my name.’ 

10. “Yahweh has performed his word that he spoke; for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
11. There I have set the ark, in which is Yahweh’s covenant, which he made with the children of Israel.” 

12. He stood before Yahweh’s altar in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands 
13. (for Solomon had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the middle of the court; and he stood on it, and knelt down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven). 
14. Then he said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven or on earth—you who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants who walk before you with all their heart; 
15. who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him. Yes, you spoke with your mouth, and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is today. 

16. “Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, keep with your servant David my father that which you have promised him, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children take heed to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.’ 
17. Now therefore, Yahweh, the God of Israel, let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David. 

18. “But will God indeed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t contain you; how much less this house which I have built! 
19. Yet have respect for the prayer of your servant and to his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays before you; 
20. that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place where you have said that you would put your name, to listen to the prayer which your servant will pray toward this place. 
21. Listen to the petitions of your servant and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. Yes, hear from your dwelling place, even from heaven; and when you hear, forgive. 

22. “If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swears before your altar in this house, 
23. then hear from heaven, act, and judge your servants, bringing retribution to the wicked, to bring his way on his own head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. 

24. “If your people Israel are struck down before the enemy because they have sinned against you, and they turn again and confess your name, and pray and make supplication before you in this house, 
25. then hear from heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them again to the land which you gave to them and to their fathers. 

26. “When the sky is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, if they pray toward this place and confess your name, and turn from their sin when you afflict them, 
27. then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk, and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance. 

28. “If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is— 
29. whatever prayer and supplication is made by any man, or by all your people Israel, who will each know his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread out his hands toward this house, 
30. then hear from heaven your dwelling place and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know (for you, even you only, know the hearts of the children of men), 
31. that they may fear you, to walk in your ways as long as they live in the land which you gave to our fathers. 

32. “Moreover, concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he comes from a far country for your great name’s sake and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm, when they come and pray toward this house, 
33. then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name. 

34. “If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you send them, and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name; 
35. then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. 

36. “If they sin against you (for there is no man who doesn’t sin), and you are angry with them and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near; 
37. yet if they come to their senses in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to you in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;’ 
38. if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have been taken captive, and pray toward their land which you gave to their fathers, and the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name; 
39. then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling place, their prayer and their petitions, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against you. 

40. “Now, my God, let, I beg you, your eyes be open, and let your ears be attentive to the prayer that is made in this place. 

41. “Now therefore arise, Yahweh God, into your resting place, you, and the ark of your strength. Let your priests, Yahweh God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints rejoice in goodness. 

42. “Yahweh God, don’t turn away the face of your anointed. Remember your loving kindnesses to David your servant.” 
** 7 

1. Now when Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and Yahweh’s glory filled the house. 
2. The priests could not enter into Yahweh’s house, because Yahweh’s glory filled Yahweh’s house. 
3. All the children of Israel looked on, when the fire came down, and Yahweh’s glory was on the house. They bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, worshiped, and gave thanks to Yahweh, saying, 
#+BEGIN_VERSE
    “For he is good, 
      for his loving kindness endures forever!” 
#+END_VERSE

4. Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before Yahweh. 
5. King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated God’s house. 
6. The priests stood, according to their positions; the Levites also with instruments of music of Yahweh, which David the king had made to give thanks to Yahweh, when David praised by their ministry, saying “For his loving kindness endures forever.” The priests sounded trumpets before them; and all Israel stood. 

7. Moreover Solomon made the middle of the court that was before Yahweh’s house holy; for there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the fat. 

8. So Solomon held the feast at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt. 

9. On the eighth day, they held a solemn assembly; for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. 
10. On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David, to Solomon, and to Israel his people. 

11. Thus Solomon finished Yahweh’s house and the king’s house; and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in Yahweh’s house and in his own house. 

12. Then Yahweh appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, “I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for myself for a house of sacrifice. 

13. “If I shut up the sky so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people, 
14. if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, pray, seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. 
15. Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to prayer that is made in this place. 
16. For now I have chosen and made this house holy, that my name may be there forever; and my eyes and my heart will be there perpetually. 

17. “As for you, if you will walk before me as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances, 
18. then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, according as I covenanted with David your father, saying, ‘There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.’ 

19. But if you turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them, 
20. then I will pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples. 
21. This house, which is so high, everyone who passes by it will be astonished and say, ‘Why has Yahweh done this to this land and to this house?’ 
22. They shall answer, ‘Because they abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and took other gods, worshiped them, and served them. Therefore he has brought all this evil on them.’” 
** 8 

1. At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built Yahweh’s house and his own house, 
2. Solomon built the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there. 

3. Solomon went to Hamath Zobah, and prevailed against it. 
4. He built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the storage cities, which he built in Hamath. 
5. Also he built Beth Horon the upper and Beth Horon the lower, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars; 
6. and Baalath, and all the storage cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 

7. As for all the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel— 
8. of their children who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel didn’t consume—of them Solomon conscripted forced labor to this day. 
9. But of the children of Israel, Solomon made no servants for his work, but they were men of war, chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen. 
10. These were the chief officers of King Solomon, even two-hundred fifty, who ruled over the people. 

11. Solomon brought up Pharaoh’s daughter out of David’s city to the house that he had built for her; for he said, “My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places where Yahweh’s ark has come are holy.” 

12. Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Yahweh on Yahweh’s altar which he had built before the porch, 
13. even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times per year, during the feast of unleavened bread, during the feast of weeks, and during the feast of booths. 

14. He appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required, the doorkeepers also by their divisions at every gate, for David the man of God had so commanded. 
15. They didn’t depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasures. 

16. Now all the work of Solomon was accomplished from the day of the foundation of Yahweh’s house until it was finished. So Yahweh’s house was completed. 

17. Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom. 
18. Huram sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants; and they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and brought from there four hundred fifty talents of gold, and brought them to King Solomon. 
** 9 

1. When the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to test Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great caravan, including camels that bore spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones. When she had come to Solomon, she talked with him about all that was in her heart. 
2. Solomon answered all her questions. There wasn’t anything hidden from Solomon which he didn’t tell her. 
3. When the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, 
4. the food of his table, the seating of his servants, the attendance of his ministers, their clothing, his cup bearers and their clothing, and his ascent by which he went up to Yahweh’s house, there was no more spirit in her. 

5. She said to the king, “It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom. 
6. However I didn’t believe their words until I came, and my eyes had seen it; and behold half of the greatness of your wisdom wasn’t told me. You exceed the fame that I heard! 
7. Happy are your men, and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom. 
8. Blessed be Yahweh your God, who delighted in you and set you on his throne to be king for Yahweh your God, because your God loved Israel, to establish them forever. Therefore he made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.” 

9. She gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great abundance, and precious stones. There was never before such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. 

10. The servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, also brought algum trees and precious stones. 
11. The king used algum tree wood to make terraces for Yahweh’s house and for the king’s house, and harps and stringed instruments for the singers. There were none like these seen before in the land of Judah. 
12. King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, more than that which she had brought to the king. So she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants. 

13. Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold, 
14. in addition to that which the traders and merchants brought. All the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. 
15. King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold. Six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one large shield. 
16. He made three hundred shields of beaten gold. Three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. The king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. 
17. Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. 
18. There were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and armrests on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the armrests. 
19. Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps. There was nothing like it made in any other kingdom. 
20. All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. Silver was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon. 
21. For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with Huram’s servants. Once every three years, the ships of Tarshish came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. 

22. So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
23. All the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 
24. They each brought tribute: vessels of silver, vessels of gold, clothing, armor, spices, horses, and mules every year. 
25. Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen that he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem. 
26. He ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. 
27. The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars to be as abundant as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland. 
28. They brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt and out of all lands. 

29. Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, aren’t they written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat? 
30. Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 
31. Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in his father David’s city; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place. 
** 10 

1. Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. 
2. When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon), Jeroboam returned out of Egypt. 
3. They sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying, 
4. “Your father made our yoke grievous. Now therefore make the grievous service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.” 

5. He said to them, “Come again to me after three days.” 
 So the people departed. 

6. King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, “What counsel do you give me about how to answer these people?” 

7. They spoke to him, saying, “If you are kind to these people, please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.” 

8. But he abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him. 
9. He said to them, “What counsel do you give, that we may give an answer to these people, who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?’” 

10. The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter on us;’ thus you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist. 
11. Now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’” 

12. So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, “Come to me again the third day.” 
13. The king answered them roughly; and King Rehoboam abandoned the counsel of the old men, 
14. and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.” 

15. So the king didn’t listen to the people; for it was brought about by God, that Yahweh might establish his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 

16. When all Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What portion do we have in David? We don’t have an inheritance in the son of Jesse! Every man to your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David.” So all Israel departed to their tents. 

17. But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 
18. Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam hurried to get himself up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 
19. So Israel rebelled against David’s house to this day. 
** 11 

1. When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam. 
2. But Yahweh’s word came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 
3. “Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, 
4. ‘Yahweh says, “You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers! Every man return to his house; for this thing is of me.”’” So they listened to Yahweh’s words, and returned from going against Jeroboam. 

5. Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah. 
6. He built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
7. Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam, 
8. Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
9. Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
10. Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin. 
11. He fortified the strongholds and put captains in them with stores of food, oil and wine. 
12. He put shields and spears in every city, and made them exceedingly strong. Judah and Benjamin belonged to him. 

13. The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel stood with him out of all their territory. 
14. For the Levites left their pasture lands and their possessions, and came to Judah and Jerusalem; for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest’s office to Yahweh. 
15. He himself appointed priests for the high places, for the male goat and calf idols which he had made. 
16. After them, out of all the tribes of Israel, those who set their hearts to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their fathers. 
17. So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong for three years, for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon. 

18. Rehoboam took a wife for himself, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse. 
19. She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 
20. After her, he took Maacah the granddaughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 
21. Rehoboam loved Maacah the granddaughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines; for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and became the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. 
22. Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, the prince among his brothers, for he intended to make him king. 
23. He dealt wisely, and dispersed some of his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city. He gave them food in abundance; and he sought many wives for them. 
** 12 

1. When the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and he was strong, he abandoned Yahweh’s law, and all Israel with him. 
2. In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Yahweh, 
3. with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen. The people were without number who came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians. 
4. He took the fortified cities which belonged to Judah, and came to Jerusalem. 
5. Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, “Yahweh says, ‘You have forsaken me, therefore I have also left you in the hand of Shishak.’” 

6. Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, “Yahweh is righteous.” 

7. When Yahweh saw that they humbled themselves, Yahweh’s word came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath won’t be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. 
8. Nevertheless they will be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.” 

9. So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem and took away the treasures of Yahweh’s house and the treasures of the king’s house. He took it all away. He also took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made. 
10. King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house. 
11. As often as the king entered into Yahweh’s house, the guard came and bore them, then brought them back into the guard room. 
12. When he humbled himself, Yahweh’s wrath turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether. Moreover, there were good things found in Judah. 

13. So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned; for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess. 
14. He did that which was evil, because he didn’t set his heart to seek Yahweh. 

15. Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, aren’t they written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, in the genealogies? There were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. 
16. Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in David’s city; and Abijah his son reigned in his place. 
** 13 

1. In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah. 
2. He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
3. Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men; and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor. 
4. Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel: 
5. Ought you not to know that Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? 
6. Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord. 
7. Worthless men were gathered to him, wicked fellows who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender hearted, and could not withstand them. 

8. “Now you intend to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David. You are a great multitude, and the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods are with you. 
9. Haven’t you driven out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves according to the ways of the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of those who are no gods. 

10. “But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken him. We have priests serving Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work. 
11. They burn to Yahweh every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense. They also set the show bread in order on the pure table, and care for the gold lamp stand with its lamps, to burn every evening; for we keep the instruction of Yahweh our God, but you have forsaken him. 
12. Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. Children of Israel, don’t fight against Yahweh, the God of your fathers; for you will not prosper.” 

13. But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them; so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them. 
14. When Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to Yahweh, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. 
15. Then the men of Judah gave a shout. As the men of Judah shouted, God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 
16. The children of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand. 
17. Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter, so five hundred thousand chosen men of Israel fell down slain. 
18. Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on Yahweh, the God of their fathers. 
19. Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him: Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages. 

20. Jeroboam didn’t recover strength again in the days of Abijah. Yahweh struck him, and he died. 
21. But Abijah grew mighty and took for himself fourteen wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. 
22. The rest of the acts of Abijah, his ways, and his sayings are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo. 
** 14 

1. So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days, the land was quiet ten years. 
2. Asa did that which was good and right in Yahweh his God’s eyes, 
3. for he took away the foreign altars and the high places, broke down the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, 
4. and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and to obey his law and command. 
5. Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images; and the kingdom was quiet before him. 
6. He built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Yahweh had given him rest. 
7. For he said to Judah, “Let’s build these cities and make walls around them, with towers, gates, and bars. The land is yet before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God. We have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered. 

8. Asa had an army of three hundred thousand out of Judah who bore bucklers and spears, and two hundred eighty thousand out of Benjamin who bore shields and drew bows. All these were mighty men of valor. 

9. Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million troops and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah. 
10. Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. 
11. Asa cried to Yahweh his God, and said, “Yahweh, there is no one besides you to help, between the mighty and him who has no strength. Help us, Yahweh our God; for we rely on you, and in your name are we come against this multitude. Yahweh, you are our God. Don’t let man prevail against you.” 

12. So Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. 
13. Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar. So many of the Ethiopians fell that they could not recover themselves, for they were destroyed before Yahweh and before his army. Judah’s army carried away very much booty. 
14. They struck all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of Yahweh came on them. They plundered all the cities, for there was much plunder in them. 
15. They also struck the tents of those who had livestock, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, then returned to Jerusalem. 
** 15 

1. The Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded. 
2. He went out to meet Asa, and said to him, “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin! Yahweh is with you while you are with him; and if you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you. 
3. Now for a long time Israel was without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law. 
4. But when in their distress they turned to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them. 
5. In those times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands. 
6. They were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God troubled them with all adversity. 
7. But you be strong! Don’t let your hands be slack, for your work will be rewarded.” 

8. When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill country of Ephraim; and he renewed Yahweh’s altar that was before Yahweh’s porch. 
9. He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who lived with them out of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon; for they came to him out of Israel in abundance when they saw that Yahweh his God was with him. 
10. So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign. 
11. They sacrificed to Yahweh in that day, of the plunder which they had brought, seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep. 
12. They entered into the covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul; 
13. and that whoever would not seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. 
14. They swore to Yahweh with a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with cornets. 
15. All Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found by them. Then Yahweh gave them rest all around. 

16. Also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen mother, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; so Asa cut down her image, ground it into dust, and burned it at the brook Kidron. 
17. But the high places were not taken away out of Israel; nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days. 
18. He brought the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated, silver, gold, and vessels into God’s house. 
19. There was no more war to the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign. 
** 16 

1. In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
2. Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of Yahweh’s house and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben Hadad king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying, 
3. “Let there be a treaty between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.” 

4. Ben Hadad listened to King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali. 
5. When Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and let his work cease. 
6. Then Asa the king took all Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber of Ramah, with which Baasha had built; and he built Geba and Mizpah with them. 

7. At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, “Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on Yahweh your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand. 
8. Weren’t the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots and exceedingly many horsemen? Yet, because you relied on Yahweh, he delivered them into your hand. 
9. For Yahweh’s eyes run back and forth throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. You have done foolishly in this; for from now on you will have wars.” 

10. Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time. 

11. Behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
12. In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa was diseased in his feet. His disease was exceedingly great; yet in his disease he didn’t seek Yahweh, but just the physicians. 
13. Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the forty-first year of his reign. 
14. They buried him in his own tomb, which he had dug out for himself in David’s city, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers’ art; and they made a very great fire for him. 
** 17 

1. Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place, and strengthened himself against Israel. 
2. He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. 
3. Yahweh was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and didn’t seek the Baals, 
4. but sought the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not in the ways of Israel. 
5. Therefore Yahweh established the kingdom in his hand. All Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had riches and honor in abundance. 
6. His heart was lifted up in the ways of Yahweh. Furthermore, he took away the high places and the Asherah poles out of Judah. 

7. Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Ben Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; 
8. and with them Levites, even Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests. 
9. They taught in Judah, having the book of Yahweh’s law with them. They went about throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people. 

10. The fear of Yahweh fell on all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat. 
11. Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute. The Arabians also brought him flocks: seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred male goats. 
12. Jehoshaphat grew great exceedingly; and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah. 
13. He had many works in the cities of Judah; and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem. 
14. This was the numbering of them according to their fathers’ houses: From Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor; 
15. and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred eighty thousand; 
16. and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to Yahweh, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor. 
17. From Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield; 
18. and next to him Jehozabad, and with him one hundred eighty thousand ready and prepared for war. 
19. These were those who waited on the king, in addition to those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah. 
** 18 

1. Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and he allied himself with Ahab. 
2. After some years, he went down to Ahab to Samaria. Ahab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance, and for the people who were with him, and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead. 
3. Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me to Ramoth Gilead?” 
 He answered him, “I am as you are, and my people as your people. We will be with you in the war.” 
4. Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for Yahweh’s word.” 

5. Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?” 
 They said, “Go up, for God will deliver it into the hand of the king.” 

6. But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there here a prophet of Yahweh besides, that we may inquire of him?” 

7. The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Yahweh; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil. He is Micaiah the son of Imla.” 
 Jehoshaphat said, “Don’t let the king say so.” 

8. Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, “Get Micaiah the son of Imla quickly.” 

9. Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah each sat on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them. 
10. Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made himself horns of iron and said, “Yahweh says, ‘With these you shall push the Syrians, until they are consumed.’” 

11. All the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.” 

12. The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Let your word therefore, please be like one of theirs, and speak good.” 

13. Micaiah said, “As Yahweh lives, I will say what my God says.” 

14. When he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?” 
 He said, “Go up, and prosper. They shall be delivered into your hand.” 

15. The king said to him, “How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in Yahweh’s name?” 

16. He said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. Yahweh said, ‘These have no master. Let them each return to his house in peace.’” 

17. The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?” 

18. Micaiah said, “Therefore hear Yahweh’s word: I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left. 
19. Yahweh said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ One spoke saying in this way, and another saying in that way. 
20. A spirit came out, stood before Yahweh, and said, ‘I will entice him.’ 
 “Yahweh said to him, ‘How?’ 

21. “He said, ‘I will go, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ 
 “He said, ‘You will entice him, and will prevail also. Go and do so.’ 

22. “Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.” 

23. Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did Yahweh’s Spirit go from me to speak to you?” 

24. Micaiah said, “Behold, you shall see on that day, when you go into an inner room to hide yourself.” 

25. The king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son; 
26. and say, ‘The king says, “Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.”’” 

27. Micaiah said, “If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me.” He said, “Listen, you people, all of you!” 

28. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. 
29. The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but you put on your robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle. 
30. Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, “Don’t fight with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.” 

31. When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is the king of Israel!” Therefore they turned around to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out, and Yahweh helped him; and God moved them to depart from him. 
32. When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. 
33. A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of the chariot, “Turn around and carry me out of the battle, for I am severely wounded.” 
34. The battle increased that day. However, the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening; and at about sunset, he died. 
** 19 

1. Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. 
2. Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked, and love those who hate Yahweh? Because of this, wrath is on you from before Yahweh. 
3. Nevertheless there are good things found in you, in that you have put away the Asheroth out of the land, and have set your heart to seek God.” 

4. Jehoshaphat lived at Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, and brought them back to Yahweh, the God of their fathers. 
5. He set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city, 
6. and said to the judges, “Consider what you do, for you don’t judge for man, but for Yahweh; and he is with you in the judgment. 
7. Now therefore let the fear of Yahweh be on you. Take heed and do it; for there is no iniquity with Yahweh our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.” 

8. Moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed certain Levites, priests, and heads of the fathers’ households of Israel to give judgment for Yahweh and for controversies. They returned to Jerusalem. 
9. He commanded them, saying, “You shall do this in the fear of Yahweh, faithfully, and with a perfect heart. 
10. Whenever any controversy comes to you from your brothers who dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, you must warn them, that they not be guilty toward Yahweh, and so wrath come on you and on your brothers. Do this, and you will not be guilty. 
11. Behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Yahweh; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king’s matters. Also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and may Yahweh be with the good.” 
** 20 

1. After this, the children of Moab, the children of Ammon, and with them some of the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle. 
2. Then some came who told Jehoshaphat, saying, “A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea from Syria. Behold, they are in Hazazon Tamar” (that is, En Gedi). 
3. Jehoshaphat was alarmed, and set himself to seek to Yahweh. He proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. 
4. Judah gathered themselves together to seek help from Yahweh. They came out of all the cities of Judah to seek Yahweh. 

5. Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in Yahweh’s house, before the new court; 
6. and he said, “Yahweh, the God of our fathers, aren’t you God in heaven? Aren’t you ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? Power and might are in your hand, so that no one is able to withstand you. 
7. Didn’t you, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and give it to the offspring of Abraham your friend forever? 
8. They lived in it, and have built you a sanctuary in it for your name, saying, 
9. ‘If evil comes on us—the sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine—we will stand before this house, and before you (for your name is in this house), and cry to you in our affliction, and you will hear and save.’ 
10. Now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir, whom you would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned away from them, and didn’t destroy them; 
11. behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of your possession, which you have given us to inherit. 
12. Our God, will you not judge them? For we have no might against this great company that comes against us. We don’t know what to do, but our eyes are on you.” 

13. All Judah stood before Yahweh, with their little ones, their wives, and their children. 

14. Then Yahweh’s Spirit came on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, in the middle of the assembly; 
15. and he said, “Listen, all Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, King Jehoshaphat. Yahweh says to you, ‘Don’t be afraid, and don’t be dismayed because of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s. 
16. Tomorrow, go down against them. Behold, they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz. You will find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel. 
17. You will not need to fight this battle. Set yourselves, stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh with you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed. Go out against them tomorrow, for Yahweh is with you.’” 

18. Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Yahweh, worshiping Yahweh. 
19. The Levites, of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites, stood up to praise Yahweh, the God of Israel, with an exceedingly loud voice. 

20. They rose early in the morning and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa. As they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in Yahweh your God, so you will be established! Believe his prophets, so you will prosper.” 

21. When he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who were to sing to Yahweh and give praise in holy array as they go out before the army, and say, “Give thanks to Yahweh, for his loving kindness endures forever.” 
22. When they began to sing and to praise, Yahweh set ambushers against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were struck. 
23. For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy them. When they had finished the inhabitants of Seir, everyone helped to destroy each other. 

24. When Judah came to the place overlooking the wilderness, they looked at the multitude; and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none who escaped. 
25. When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their plunder, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies with precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away. They took plunder for three days, it was so much. 
26. On the fourth day, they assembled themselves in Beracah Valley, for there they blessed Yahweh. Therefore the name of that place was called “Beracah Valley” to this day. 
27. Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat in front of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for Yahweh had made them to rejoice over their enemies. 
28. They came to Jerusalem with stringed instruments, harps, and trumpets to Yahweh’s house. 
29. The fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard that Yahweh fought against the enemies of Israel. 
30. So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all around. 

31. So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign. He reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
32. He walked in the way of Asa his father, and didn’t turn away from it, doing that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes. 
33. However the high places were not taken away, and the people had still not set their hearts on the God of their fathers. 

34. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is included in the book of the kings of Israel. 

35. After this, Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel. The same did very wickedly. 
36. He joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish. They made the ships in Ezion Geber. 
37. Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have joined yourself with Ahaziah, Yahweh has destroyed your works.” The ships were wrecked, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish. 
** 21 

1. Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in David’s city; and Jehoram his son reigned in his place. 
2. He had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. 
3. Their father gave them great gifts of silver, of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn. 
4. Now when Jehoram had risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and also some of the princes of Israel. 
5. Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
6. He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did Ahab’s house, for he had Ahab’s daughter as his wife. He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight. 
7. However Yahweh would not destroy David’s house, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children always. 

8. In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. 
9. Then Jehoram went there with his captains and all his chariots with him. He rose up by night and struck the Edomites who surrounded him, along with the captains of the chariots. 
10. So Edom has been in revolt from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Yahweh, the God of his fathers. 

11. Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem play the prostitute, and led Judah astray. 
12. A letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, “Yahweh, the God of David your father, says, ‘Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat your father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah, 
13. but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the prostitute like Ahab’s house did, and also have slain your brothers of your father’s house, who were better than yourself, 
14. behold, Yahweh will strike your people with a great plague, including your children, your wives, and all your possessions; 
15. and you will have great sickness with a disease of your bowels, until your bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.’” 

16. Yahweh stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and of the Arabians who are beside the Ethiopians; 
17. and they came up against Judah, broke into it, and carried away all the possessions that were found in the king’s house, including his sons and his wives, so that there was no son left to him except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons. 

18. After all this Yahweh struck him in his bowels with an incurable disease. 
19. In process of time, at the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died of severe diseases. His people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers. 
20. He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. He departed with no one’s regret. They buried him in David’s city, but not in the tombs of the kings. 
** 22 

1. The inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his place, because the band of men who came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the oldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. 
2. Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri. 
3. He also walked in the ways of Ahab’s house, because his mother was his counselor in acting wickedly. 
4. He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as did Ahab’s house, for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction. 
5. He also followed their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram. 
6. He returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. Azariah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick. 

7. Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went to Joram; for when he had come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had anointed to cut off Ahab’s house. 
8. When Jehu was executing judgment on Ahab’s house, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah serving Ahaziah, and killed them. 
9. He sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu and killed him; and they buried him, for they said, “He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh with all his heart.” The house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom. 

10. Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring of the house of Judah. 
11. But Jehoshabeath, the king’s daughter, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stealthily rescued him from among the king’s sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedroom. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she didn’t kill him. 
12. He was with them hidden in God’s house six years while Athaliah reigned over the land. 
** 23 

1. In the seventh year, Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds—Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri—into a covenant with him. 
2. They went around in Judah and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers’ households of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. 
3. All the assembly made a covenant with the king in God’s house. Jehoiada said to them, “Behold, the king’s son must reign, as Yahweh has spoken concerning the sons of David. 
4. This is the thing that you must do: a third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be gatekeepers of the thresholds. 
5. A third part shall be at the king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation. All the people will be in the courts of Yahweh’s house. 
6. But let no one come into Yahweh’s house except the priests and those who minister of the Levites. They shall come in, for they are holy, but all the people shall follow Yahweh’s instructions. 
7. The Levites shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand. Whoever comes into the house, let him be slain. Be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.” 

8. So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. They each took his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were to go out on the Sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest didn’t dismiss the shift. 
9. Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, bucklers, and shields that had been king David’s, which were in God’s house. 
10. He set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, near the altar and the house, around the king. 
11. Then they brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, gave him the covenant, and made him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and they said, “Long live the king!” 

12. When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into Yahweh’s house. 
13. Then she looked, and behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, with the captains and the trumpeters by the king. All the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets. The singers also played musical instruments, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and said, “Treason! treason!” 

14. Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks; and whoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword.” For the priest said, “Don’t kill her in Yahweh’s house.” 
15. So they made way for her. She went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king’s house; and they killed her there. 

16. Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, all the people, and the king, that they should be Yahweh’s people. 
17. All the people went to the house of Baal, broke it down, broke his altars and his images in pieces, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. 
18. Jehoiada appointed the officers of Yahweh’s house under the hand of the Levitical priests, whom David had distributed in Yahweh’s house, to offer the burnt offerings of Yahweh, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as David had ordered. 
19. He set the gatekeepers at the gates of Yahweh’s house, that no one who was unclean in anything should enter in. 
20. He took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought the king down from Yahweh’s house. They came through the upper gate to the king’s house, and set the king on the throne of the kingdom. 
21. So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. They had slain Athaliah with the sword. 
** 24 

1. Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah, of Beersheba. 
2. Joash did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes all the days of Jehoiada the priest. 
3. Jehoiada took for him two wives, and he became the father of sons and daughters. 

4. After this, Joash intended to restore Yahweh’s house. 
5. He gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, “Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather money to repair the house of your God from all Israel from year to year. See that you expedite this matter.” However the Levites didn’t do it right away. 
6. The king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, “Why haven’t you required of the Levites to bring in the tax of Moses the servant of Yahweh, and of the assembly of Israel, out of Judah and out of Jerusalem, for the Tent of the Testimony?” 
7. For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up God’s house; and they also gave all the dedicated things of Yahweh’s house to the Baals. 

8. So the king commanded, and they made a chest, and set it outside at the gate of Yahweh’s house. 
9. They made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in for Yahweh the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness. 
10. All the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had filled it. 
11. Whenever the chest was brought to the king’s officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance. 
12. The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of Yahweh’s house. They hired masons and carpenters to restore Yahweh’s house, and also those who worked iron and bronze to repair Yahweh’s house. 
13. So the workmen worked, and the work of repairing went forward in their hands. They set up God’s house as it was designed, and strengthened it. 
14. When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, from which were made vessels for Yahweh’s house, even vessels with which to minister and to offer, including spoons and vessels of gold and silver. They offered burnt offerings in Yahweh’s house continually all the days of Jehoiada. 

15. But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died. He was one hundred thirty years old when he died. 
16. They buried him in David’s city among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house. 

17. Now after the death of Jehoiada, the princes of Judah came and bowed down to the king. Then the king listened to them. 
18. They abandoned the house of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherah poles and the idols, so wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness. 
19. Yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again to Yahweh, and they testified against them; but they would not listen. 

20. The Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people, and said to them, “God says, ‘Why do you disobey Yahweh’s commandments, so that you can’t prosper? Because you have forsaken Yahweh, he has also forsaken you.’” 

21. They conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of Yahweh’s house. 
22. Thus Joash the king didn’t remember the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but killed his son. When he died, he said, “May Yahweh look at it, and repay it.” 

23. At the end of the year, the army of the Syrians came up against him. They came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all their plunder to the king of Damascus. 
24. For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men; and Yahweh delivered a very great army into their hand, because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers. So they executed judgment on Joash. 

25. When they had departed from him (for they left him seriously wounded), his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and killed him on his bed, and he died. They buried him in David’s city, but they didn’t bury him in the tombs of the kings. 
26. These are those who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess. 
27. Now concerning his sons, the greatness of the burdens laid on him, and the rebuilding of God’s house, behold, they are written in the commentary of the book of the kings. Amaziah his son reigned in his place. 
** 25 

1. Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem. 
2. He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, but not with a perfect heart. 
3. Now when the kingdom was established to him, he killed his servants who had killed his father the king. 
4. But he didn’t put their children to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, “The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.” 

5. Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and ordered them according to their fathers’ houses, under captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin. He counted them from twenty years old and upward, and found that there were three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go out to war, who could handle spear and shield. 
6. He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver. 
7. A man of God came to him, saying, “O king, don’t let the army of Israel go with you, for Yahweh is not with Israel, with all the children of Ephraim. 
8. But if you will go, take action, and be strong for the battle. God will overthrow you before the enemy; for God has power to help, and to overthrow.” 

9. Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?” 
 The man of God answered, “Yahweh is able to give you much more than this.” 

10. Then Amaziah separated them, the army that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again. Therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger. 

11. Amaziah took courage, and led his people out and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck ten thousand of the children of Seir. 
12. The children of Judah carried away ten thousand alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and threw them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces. 
13. But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah from Samaria even to Beth Horon, and struck of them three thousand, and took much plunder. 

14. Now after Amaziah had come from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them and burned incense to them. 
15. Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet who said to him, “Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of your hand?” 

16. As he talked with him, the king said to him, “Have we made you one of the king’s counselors? Stop! Why should you be struck down?” 
 Then the prophet stopped, and said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel.” 

17. Then Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, “Come! Let’s look one another in the face.” 

18. Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as his wife. Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle. 
19. You say to yourself that you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast. Now stay at home. Why should you meddle with trouble, that you should fall, even you and Judah with you?’” 

20. But Amaziah would not listen; for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom. 
21. So Joash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah. 
22. Judah was defeated by Israel; so every man fled to his tent. 

23. Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits. 
24. He took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in God’s house with Obed-Edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, and the hostages, and returned to Samaria. 

25. Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel. 
26. Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, aren’t they written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? 
27. Now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following Yahweh, they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. He fled to Lachish, but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there. 
28. They brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the City of Judah. 
** 26 

1. All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah. 
2. He built Eloth and restored it to Judah. After that the king slept with his fathers. 
3. Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jechiliah, of Jerusalem. 
4. He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that his father Amaziah had done. 
5. He set himself to seek God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the vision of God; and as long as he sought Yahweh, God made him prosper. 

6. He went out and fought against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities in the country of Ashdod, and among the Philistines. 
7. God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians who lived in Gur Baal, and the Meunim. 
8. The Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah. His name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt, for he grew exceedingly strong. 
9. Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them. 
10. He built towers in the wilderness, and dug out many cisterns, for he had much livestock, both in the lowlands and in the plains. He had farmers and vineyard keepers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields, for he loved farming. 
11. Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men who went out to war by bands, according to the number of their reckoning made by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains. 
12. The whole number of the heads of fathers’ households, even the mighty men of valor, was two thousand six hundred. 
13. Under their hand was an army, three hundred seven thousand five hundred, who made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. 
14. Uzziah prepared for them, even for all the army, shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and stones for slinging. 
15. In Jerusalem, he made devices, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and on the battlements, with which to shoot arrows and great stones. His name spread far abroad, because he was marvelously helped until he was strong. 

16. But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly and he trespassed against Yahweh his God, for he went into Yahweh’s temple to burn incense on the altar of incense. 
17. Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of Yahweh, who were valiant men. 
18. They resisted Uzziah the king, and said to him, “It isn’t for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Yahweh, but for the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Go out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed. It will not be for your honor from Yahweh God.” 

19. Then Uzziah was angry. He had a censer in his hand to burn incense, and while he was angry with the priests, the leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in Yahweh’s house, beside the altar of incense. 
20. Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked at him, and behold, he was leprous in his forehead; and they thrust him out quickly from there. Indeed, he himself also hurried to go out, because Yahweh had struck him. 
21. Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from Yahweh’s house. Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land. 

22. Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote. 
23. So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings, for they said, “He is a leper.” Jotham his son reigned in his place. 
** 27 

1. Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok. 
2. He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that his father Uzziah had done. However he didn’t enter into Yahweh’s temple. The people still acted corruptly. 
3. He built the upper gate of Yahweh’s house, and he built much on the wall of Ophel. 
4. Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers. 
5. He also fought with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them. The children of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat, and ten thousand cors of barley. The children of Ammon also gave that much to him in the second year, and in the third. 
6. So Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways before Yahweh his God. 
7. Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
8. He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
9. Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Ahaz his son reigned in his place. 
** 28 

1. Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He didn’t do that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, like David his father, 
2. but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and also made molten images for the Baals. 
3. Moreover he burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burned his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel. 
4. He sacrificed and burned incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. 

5. Therefore Yahweh his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria. They struck him, and carried away from him a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. He was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him with a great slaughter. 
6. For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men, because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers. 
7. Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king’s son, Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah who was next to the king. 
8. The children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters, and also took away much plunder from them, and brought the plunder to Samaria. 
9. But a prophet of Yahweh was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria, and said to them, “Behold, because Yahweh, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven. 
10. Now you intend to degrade the children of Judah and Jerusalem as male and female slaves for yourselves. Aren’t there even with you trespasses of your own against Yahweh your God? 
11. Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives that you have taken captive from your brothers, for the fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you.” 
12. Then some of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war, 
13. and said to them, “You must not bring in the captives here, for you intend that which will bring on us a trespass against Yahweh, to add to our sins and to our guilt; for our guilt is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.” 

14. So the armed men left the captives and the plunder before the princes and all the assembly. 
15. The men who have been mentioned by name rose up and took the captives, and with the plunder clothed all who were naked among them, dressed them, gave them sandals, gave them something to eat and to drink, anointed them, carried all the feeble of them on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria. 

16. At that time King Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him. 
17. For again the Edomites had come and struck Judah, and carried away captives. 
18. The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and also Gimzo and its villages; and they lived there. 
19. For Yahweh brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel, because he acted without restraint in Judah and trespassed severely against Yahweh. 
20. Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came to him and gave him trouble, but didn’t strengthen him. 
21. For Ahaz took away a portion out of Yahweh’s house, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria; but it didn’t help him. 

22. In the time of his distress, he trespassed yet more against Yahweh, this same King Ahaz. 
23. For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him. He said, “Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, I will sacrifice to them, that they may help me.” But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel. 
24. Ahaz gathered together the vessels of God’s house, cut the vessels of God’s house in pieces, and shut up the doors of Yahweh’s house; and he made himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem. 
25. In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked Yahweh, the God of his fathers, to anger. 

26. Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
27. Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem, because they didn’t bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place. 
** 29 

1. Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. 
2. He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, according to all that David his father had done. 
3. In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of Yahweh’s house and repaired them. 
4. He brought in the priests and the Levites and gathered them together into the wide place on the east, 
5. and said to them, “Listen to me, you Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Yahweh, the God of your fathers, and carry the filthiness out of the holy place. 
6. For our fathers were unfaithful, and have done that which was evil in Yahweh our God’s sight, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh, and turned their backs. 
7. Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel. 
8. Therefore Yahweh’s wrath was on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to be tossed back and forth, to be an astonishment and a hissing, as you see with your eyes. 
9. For behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. 
10. Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Yahweh, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us. 
11. My sons, don’t be negligent now; for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him, to minister to him, and that you should be his ministers and burn incense.” 

12. Then the Levites arose: Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah; 
13. and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; 
14. and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel. 
15. They gathered their brothers, sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by Yahweh’s words, to cleanse Yahweh’s house. 
16. The priests went into the inner part of Yahweh’s house to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in Yahweh’s temple into the court of Yahweh’s house. The Levites took it from there to carry it out to the brook Kidron. 
17. Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month they came to Yahweh’s porch. They sanctified Yahweh’s house in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they finished. 
18. Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace and said, “We have cleansed all Yahweh’s house, including the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, and the table of show bread with all its vessels. 
19. Moreover, we have prepared and sanctified all the vessels which King Ahaz threw away in his reign when he was unfaithful. Behold, they are before Yahweh’s altar.” 

20. Then Hezekiah the king arose early, gathered the princes of the city, and went up to Yahweh’s house. 
21. They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. He commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on Yahweh’s altar. 
22. So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. They killed the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. They also killed the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar. 
23. They brought near the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands on them. 
24. Then the priests killed them, and they made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel. 

25. He set the Levites in Yahweh’s house with cymbals, with stringed instruments, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was from Yahweh by his prophets. 
26. The Levites stood with David’s instruments, and the priests with the trumpets. 
27. Hezekiah commanded them to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, Yahweh’s song also began, along with the trumpets and instruments of David king of Israel. 
28. All the assembly worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded. All this continued until the burnt offering was finished. 

29. When they had finished offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped. 
30. Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. They sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped. 

31. Then Hezekiah answered, “Now you have consecrated yourselves to Yahweh. Come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into Yahweh’s house.” The assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings, and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings. 
32. The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs. All these were for a burnt offering to Yahweh. 
33. The consecrated things were six hundred head of cattle and three thousand sheep. 
34. But the priests were too few, so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings. Therefore their brothers the Levites helped them until the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves, for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests. 
35. Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of Yahweh’s house was set in order. 
36. Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because of that which God had prepared for the people; for the thing was done suddenly. 
** 30 

1. Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to Yahweh’s house at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
2. For the king had taken counsel with his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem to keep the Passover in the second month. 
3. For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, and the people had not gathered themselves together to Jerusalem. 
4. The thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly. 
5. So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem, for they had not kept it in great numbers in the way it is written. 

6. So the couriers went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, according to the commandment of the king, saying, “You children of Israel, turn again to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant of you that have escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria. 
7. Don’t be like your fathers and like your brothers, who trespassed against Yahweh, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as you see. 
8. Now don’t be stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to Yahweh, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever, and serve Yahweh your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you. 
9. For if you turn again to Yahweh, your brothers and your children will find compassion with those who led them captive, and will come again into this land, because Yahweh your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you if you return to him.” 

10. So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun, but people ridiculed them and mocked them. 
11. Nevertheless some men of Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 
12. Also the hand of God came on Judah to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by Yahweh’s word. 

13. Many people assembled at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly. 
14. They arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and they took away all the altars for incense and threw them into the brook Kidron. 
15. Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into Yahweh’s house. 
16. They stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites. 
17. For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites were in charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to Yahweh. 
18. For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover other than the way it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, “May the good Yahweh pardon everyone 
19. who sets his heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of his fathers, even if they aren’t clean according to the purification of the sanctuary.” 

20. Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people. 
21. The children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness. The Levites and the priests praised Yahweh day by day, singing with loud instruments to Yahweh. 
22. Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of Yahweh. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace offerings and making confession to Yahweh, the God of their fathers. 

23. The whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days, and they kept another seven days with gladness. 
24. For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. 
25. All the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came out of Israel, and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel and who lived in Judah, rejoiced. 
26. So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was nothing like this in Jerusalem. 
27. Then the Levitical priests arose and blessed the people. Their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven. 
** 31 

1. Now when all this was finished, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah and broke the pillars in pieces, cut down the Asherah poles, and broke down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, also in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities. 

2. Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of Yahweh’s camp. 
3. He also appointed the king’s portion of his possessions for the burnt offerings: for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths, for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in Yahweh’s law. 
4. Moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to Yahweh’s law. 
5. As soon as the commandment went out, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first fruits of grain, new wine, oil, honey, and of all the increase of the field; and they brought in the tithe of all things abundantly. 
6. The children of Israel and Judah, who lived in the cities of Judah, also brought in the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to Yahweh their God, and laid them in heaps. 

7. In the third month, they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month. 
8. When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed Yahweh and his people Israel. 
9. Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps. 
10. Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, “Since people began to bring the offerings into Yahweh’s house, we have eaten and had enough, and have plenty left over, for Yahweh has blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.” 

11. Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare rooms in Yahweh’s house, and they prepared them. 
12. They brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the dedicated things faithfully. Conaniah the Levite was ruler over them, and Shimei his brother was second. 
13. Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of God’s house. 
14. Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the gatekeeper at the east gate, was over the free will offerings of God, to distribute Yahweh’s offerings and the most holy things. 
15. Under him were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brothers by divisions, to the great as well as to the small; 
16. in addition to those who were listed by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even everyone who entered into Yahweh’s house, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their divisions; 
17. and those who were listed by genealogy of the priests by their fathers’ houses, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their offices by their divisions; 
18. and those who were listed by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation; for in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness. 
19. Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the pasture lands of their cities, in every city, there were men who were mentioned by name to give portions to all the males among the priests and to all who were listed by genealogy among the Levites. 

20. Hezekiah did so throughout all Judah; and he did that which was good, right, and faithful before Yahweh his God. 
21. In every work that he began in the service of God’s house, in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart and prospered. 
** 32 

1. After these things and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, entered into Judah, encamped against the fortified cities, and intended to win them for himself. 
2. When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come, and that he was planning to fight against Jerusalem, 
3. he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city, and they helped him. 
4. Then many people gathered together and they stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the middle of the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find abundant water?” 

5. He took courage, built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, with the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo in David’s city, and made weapons and shields in abundance. 
6. He set captains of war over the people, gathered them together to him in the wide place at the gate of the city, and spoke encouragingly to them, saying, 
7. “Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or dismayed because of the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude who is with him; for there is a greater one with us than with him. 
8. An arm of flesh is with him, but Yahweh our God is with us to help us and to fight our battles.” The people rested themselves on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah. 

9. After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem, (now he was attacking Lachish, and all his forces were with him), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem, saying, 
10. Sennacherib king of Assyria says, “In whom do you trust, that you remain under siege in Jerusalem? 
11. Doesn’t Hezekiah persuade you to give you over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, ‘Yahweh our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?’ 
12. Hasn’t the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You shall worship before one altar, and you shall burn incense on it?’ 
13. Don’t you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand? 
14. Who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand? 
15. Now therefore don’t let Hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you in this way. Don’t believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand?” 

16. His servants spoke yet more against Yahweh God and against his servant Hezekiah. 
17. He also wrote letters insulting Yahweh, the God of Israel, and speaking against him, saying, “As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall the God of Hezekiah not deliver his people out of my hand.” 
18. They called out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them and to trouble them, that they might take the city. 
19. They spoke of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of men’s hands. 

20. Hezekiah the king and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed because of this, and cried to heaven. 

21. Yahweh sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty men of valor, the leaders, and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. When he had come into the house of his god, those who came out of his own body killed him there with the sword. 
22. Thus Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side. 
23. Many brought gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from then on. 

24. In those days Hezekiah was terminally ill, and he prayed to Yahweh; and he spoke to him, and gave him a sign. 
25. But Hezekiah didn’t reciprocate appropriate to the benefit done for him, because his heart was lifted up. Therefore there was wrath on him, Judah, and Jerusalem. 
26. However, Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that Yahweh’s wrath didn’t come on them in the days of Hezekiah. 

27. Hezekiah had exceedingly great riches and honor. He provided himself with treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of valuable vessels; 
28. also storehouses for the increase of grain, new wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of animals, and flocks in folds. 
29. Moreover he provided for himself cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him abundant possessions. 
30. This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and brought them straight down on the west side of David’s city. Hezekiah prospered in all his works. 

31. However, concerning the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him to test him, that he might know all that was in his heart. 

32. Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
33. Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent to the tombs of the sons of David. All Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. Manasseh his son reigned in his place. 
** 33 

1. Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. 
2. He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel. 
3. For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he raised up altars for the Baals, made Asheroth, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them. 
4. He built altars in Yahweh’s house, of which Yahweh said, “My name shall be in Jerusalem forever.” 
5. He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of Yahweh’s house. 
6. He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom. He practiced sorcery, divination, and witchcraft, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits and with wizards. He did much evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger. 
7. He set the engraved image of the idol, which he had made, in God’s house, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever. 
8. I will not any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law, the statutes, and the ordinances given by Moses.” 
9. Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did more evil than did the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel. 

10. Yahweh spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they didn’t listen. 
11. Therefore Yahweh brought on them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon. 

12. When he was in distress, he begged Yahweh his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers. 
13. He prayed to him; and he was entreated by him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Yahweh was God. 

14. Now after this, he built an outer wall to David’s city on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate. He encircled Ophel with it, and raised it up to a very great height; and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah. 
15. He took away the foreign gods and the idol out of Yahweh’s house, and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of Yahweh’s house and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city. 
16. He built up Yahweh’s altar, and offered sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving on it, and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
17. Nevertheless the people still sacrificed in the high places, but only to Yahweh their God. 

18. Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel. 
19. His prayer also, and how God listened to his request, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places and set up the Asherah poles and the engraved images before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai. 
20. So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house; and Amon his son reigned in his place. 

21. Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. 
22. He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them. 
23. He didn’t humble himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more. 
24. His servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house. 
25. But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place. 
** 34 

1. Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. 
2. He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, and walked in the ways of David his father, and didn’t turn away to the right hand or to the left. 
3. For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, the Asherah poles, the engraved images, and the molten images. 
4. They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence; and he cut down the incense altars that were on high above them. He broke the Asherah poles, the engraved images, and the molten images in pieces, made dust of them, and scattered it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. 
5. He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem. 
6. He did this in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, even to Naphtali, around in their ruins. 
7. He broke down the altars, beat the Asherah poles and the engraved images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, then returned to Jerusalem. 

8. Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder to repair the house of Yahweh his God. 
9. They came to Hilkiah the high priest and delivered the money that was brought into God’s house, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered from the hands of Manasseh, Ephraim, of all the remnant of Israel, of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
10. They delivered it into the hands of the workmen who had the oversight of Yahweh’s house; and the workmen who labored in Yahweh’s house gave it to mend and repair the house. 
11. They gave it to the carpenters and to the builders to buy cut stone and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed. 
12. The men did the work faithfully. Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to give direction; and others of the Levites, who were all skillful with musical instruments. 
13. Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and directed all who did the work in every kind of service. Of the Levites, there were scribes, officials, and gatekeepers. 

14. When they brought out the money that was brought into Yahweh’s house, Hilkiah the priest found the book of Yahweh’s law given by Moses. 
15. Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in Yahweh’s house.” So Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan. 

16. Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, “All that was committed to your servants, they are doing. 
17. They have emptied out the money that was found in Yahweh’s house, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and into the hand of the workmen.” 
18. Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book.” Shaphan read from it to the king. 

19. When the king had heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes. 
20. The king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying, 
21. “Go inquire of Yahweh for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is Yahweh’s wrath that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept Yahweh’s word, to do according to all that is written in this book.” 

22. So Hilkiah and those whom the king had commanded went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter), and they spoke to her to that effect. 

23. She said to them, “Yahweh, the God of Israel says: ‘Tell the man who sent you to me, 
24. “Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on this place and on its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah. 
25. Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands, therefore my wrath is poured out on this place, and it will not be quenched.’”’ 
26. But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, you shall tell him this, ‘Yahweh, the God of Israel says: “About the words which you have heard, 
27. because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and against its inhabitants, and have humbled yourself before me, and have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you,” says Yahweh. 
28. “Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes won’t see all the evil that I will bring on this place and on its inhabitants.”’” 
 They brought back this message to the king. 

29. Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
30. The king went up to Yahweh’s house with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem—the priests, the Levites, and all the people, both great and small—and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in Yahweh’s house. 
31. The king stood in his place and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, his testimonies, and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book. 
32. He caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. 
33. Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that belonged to the children of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Yahweh their God. All his days they didn’t depart from following Yahweh, the God of their fathers. 
** 35 

1. Josiah kept a Passover to Yahweh in Jerusalem. They killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. 
2. He set the priests in their offices and encouraged them in the service of Yahweh’s house. 
3. He said to the Levites who taught all Israel, who were holy to Yahweh, “Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built. It will no longer be a burden on your shoulders. Now serve Yahweh your God and his people Israel. 
4. Prepare yourselves after your fathers’ houses by your divisions, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son. 
5. Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of your brothers the children of the people, and let there be for each a portion of a fathers’ house of the Levites. 
6. Kill the Passover lamb, sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brothers, to do according to Yahweh’s word by Moses.” 

7. Josiah gave to the children of the people, of the flock, lambs and young goats, all of them for the Passover offerings, to all who were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls. These were of the king’s substance. 
8. His princes gave a free will offering to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the rulers of God’s house, gave to the priests for the Passover offerings two thousand six hundred small livestock, and three hundred head of cattle. 
9. Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover offerings five thousand small livestock and five hundred head of cattle. 

10. So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their divisions, according to the king’s commandment. 
11. They killed the Passover lambs, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from their hands, and the Levites skinned them. 
12. They removed the burnt offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers’ houses of the children of the people, to offer to Yahweh, as it is written in the book of Moses. They did the same with the cattle. 
13. They roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance. They boiled the holy offerings in pots, in cauldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people. 
14. Afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night. Therefore the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron. 
15. The singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place, according to the commandment of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer; and the gatekeepers were at every gate. They didn’t need to depart from their service, because their brothers the Levites prepared for them. 

16. So all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt offerings on Yahweh’s altar, according to the commandment of King Josiah. 
17. The children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. 
18. There was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet, nor did any of the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept—with the priests, the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
19. This Passover was kept in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah. 

20. After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates, and Josiah went out against him. 
21. But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, “What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? I come not against you today, but against the house with which I have war. God has commanded me to make haste. Beware that it is God who is with me, that he not destroy you.” 

22. Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and didn’t listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo. 
23. The archers shot at King Josiah; and the king said to his servants, “Take me away, because I am seriously wounded!” 

24. So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. 
25. Jeremiah lamented for Josiah, and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel. Behold, they are written in the lamentations. 
26. Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his good deeds, according to that which is written in Yahweh’s law, 
27. and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
** 36 

1. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s place in Jerusalem. 
2. Joahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. 
3. The king of Egypt removed him from office at Jerusalem, and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. 
4. The king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoiakim. Neco took Joahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt. 

5. Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. He did that which was evil in Yahweh his God’s sight. 
6. Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against him, and bound him in fetters to carry him to Babylon. 
7. Nebuchadnezzar also carried some of the vessels of Yahweh’s house to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon. 
8. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place. 

9. Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight. 
10. At the return of the year, King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, with the valuable vessels of Yahweh’s house, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem. 

11. Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. 
12. He did that which was evil in Yahweh his God’s sight. He didn’t humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from Yahweh’s mouth. 
13. He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God; but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel. 
14. Moreover all the chiefs of the priests and the people trespassed very greatly after all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted Yahweh’s house which he had made holy in Jerusalem. 

15. Yahweh, the God of their fathers, sent to them by his messengers, rising up early and sending, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place; 
16. but they mocked the messengers of God, despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until Yahweh’s wrath arose against his people, until there was no remedy. 

17. Therefore he brought on them the king of the Chaldeans, who killed their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or infirm. He gave them all into his hand. 
18. All the vessels of God’s house, great and small, and the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon. 
19. They burned God’s house, broke down the wall of Jerusalem, burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all of its valuable vessels. 
20. He carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon, and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia, 
21. to fulfill Yahweh’s word by Jeremiah’s mouth, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths. As long as it lay desolate, it kept Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years. 

22. Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that Yahweh’s word by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, 
23. “Cyrus king of Persia says, ‘Yahweh, the God of heaven, has given all the kingdoms of the earth to me; and he has commanded me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, Yahweh his God be with him, and let him go up.’”
