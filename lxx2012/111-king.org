* III Kingdoms
** 1
1. And king David was old and advanced in days, and they covered him with clothes, and he was not warmed.
2. And his servants said, Let them seek for the king a young virgin, and she shall wait on the king, and cherish him, and lie with him, and my lord the king shall be warmed.
3. So they sought for a fair damsel out of all the coasts of Israel; and they found Abisag the Somanite, and they brought her to the king.
4. And the damsel was extremely beautiful, and she cherished the king, and ministered to him, but the king knew her not.
5. And Adonias the son of Aggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king; and he prepared for himself chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
6. And his father never at any time checked him, saying, Why have you done thus? and he was also very handsome in appearance, and his mother bore him after Abessalom.
7. And he conferred with Joab the son of Saruia, and with Abiathar the priest, and they followed after Adonias.
8. But Sadoc the priest, and Banaeas the son of Jodae, and Nathan the prophet, and Semei, and Resi, and the mighty men of David, did not follow Adonias.
9. And Adonias sacrificed sheep and calves and lambs by the stone of Zoelethi, which was near Rogel: and he called all his brethren, and all the adult men of Juda, servants of the king.
10. But Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he did not call.
11. And Nathan spoke to Bersabee the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast you not heard that Adonias the son of Aggith reigns, and our lord David knows it not?
12. And now come, let me, I pray, give you counsel, and you shall rescue your life, and the life of your son Solomon.
13. Haste, and go in to king David, and you shall speak to him, saying, Hast not you, my lord, O king, sworn to your handmaid, saying, Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then does Adonias reign?
14. And behold, while you are still speaking there with the king, I also will come in after you, and will confirm your words.
15. So Bersabee went in to the king into the chamber: and the king was very old, and Abisag the Somanite was ministering to the king.
16. And Bersabee bowed, and did obeisance to the king; and the king said, What is your request?
17. And she said, My lord, you did swear by the Lord your God to your handmaid, saying, Your son Solomon shall reign after me, and shall sit upon my throne.
18. And now, behold, Adonias reigns, and you, my lord, O king, know it not.
19. And he has sacrificed calves and lambs and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander-in-chief of the host; but Solomon your servant he has not called.
20. And you, my lord, O king, —the eyes of all Israel are upon you, to tell them who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him.
21. And it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and Solomon my son shall be offenders.
22. And behold, while she was yet talking with the king, Nathan the prophet came. And it was reported to the king,
23. Behold, Nathan the prophet is here: and he came in to the king's presence, and did obeisance to the king with his face to the ground.
24. And Nathan said, My lord, O king, did you say, Adonias shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
25. For he has gone down today, and has sacrificed calves and lambs and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the chiefs of the army, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and they said, Long live king Adonias.
26. But he has not invited me your servant, and Sadoc the priest, and Banaeas the son of Jodae, and Solomon your servant.
27. Has this matter happened by the authority of my lord the king, and have you not made known to your servant who shall sit upon the throne of my lord the king after him?
28. And king David answered and said, Call me Bersabee: and she came in before the king, and stood before him.
29. And the king swore, and said, As the Lord lives who redeemed my soul out of all affliction,
30. as I swore to you by the Lord God of Israel, saying, Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead, so will I do this day.
31. And Bersabee bowed with her face to the ground, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
32. And king David said, Call me Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas the son of Jodae: and they came in before the king.
33. And the king said to them, Take the servants of your lord with you, and mount my son Solomon upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gion.
34. And there let Sadoc the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him to be king over Israel, and do you° sound the trumpet, and you° shall say, Let king Solomon live.
35. And he shall sit upon my throne, and reign in my stead: and I have given charge that he should be for a prince over Israel and Juda.
36. And Banaeas the son of Jodae answered the king and said, So let it be: may the Lord God of my lord the king confirm it.
37. As the Lord was with my lord the king, so let him be with Solomon, and let him exalt his throne beyond the throne of my lord king David.
38. And Sadoc the priest went down, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas son of Jodae, and the Cherethite, and the Phelethite, and they mounted Solomon upon the mule of king David, and led him away to Gion.
39. And Sadoc the priest took the horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon, and blew the trumpet; and all the people said, Let king Solomon live.
40. And all the people went up after him, and they danced in choirs, and rejoiced with great joy, and the earth quaked with their voice.
41. And Adonias and all his guests heard, and they had just left off eating: and Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, and said, What means the voice of the city in tumult?
42. While he was yet speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came in: and Adonias said, Come in, for you are a mighty man, and you come to bring glad tidings.
43. And Jonathan answered and said, Verily our lord king David has made Solomon king:
44. and the king has sent with him Sadoc the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Banaeas the son of Jodae, and the Cherethite, and the Phelethite, and they have mounted him on the king's mule;
45. and Sadoc the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him in Gion, and have gone up thence rejoicing, and the city resounded: this is the sound which you° have heard.
46. And Solomon is seated upon the throne of the kingdom.
47. And the servants of the king have gone in to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne; and the king worshipped upon his bed.
48. Moreover thus said the king, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who has this day appointed one of my seed sitting on my throne, and my eyes see it.
49. And all the guests of Adonias were dismayed, and every man went his way.
50. And Adonias feared because of Solomon, and arose, and departed, and laid hold on the horns of the altar.
51. And it was reported to Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonias fears king Solomon, and holds the horns of the altar, saying, Let Solomon swear to me this day, that he will not kill his servant with the sword.
52. And Solomon said, If he should be a valiant man, there shall not a hair of his fall to the ground; but if evil be found in him, he shall die.
53. And king Solomon sent, and they brought him away from the altar; and he went in and did obeisance to king Solomon: and Solomon said to him, Go to your house.
** 2
1. And the days of David drew near that he should die: and he addressed his son Solomon, saying, I go the way of all the earth:
2. but be you strong, and show yourself a man;
3. and keep the charge of the Lord your God, to walk in his ways, to keep the commandments and the ordinances and the judgments which are written in the law of Moses; that you may understand what you shall do in all things that I command you:
4. that the Lord may confirm his word which he spoke, saying, If your children shall take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart, I promise you, saying, there shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel.
5. Moreover you know all that Joab the son of Saruia did to me, what he did to the two captains of the forces of Israel, to Abenner the son of Ner, and to Amessai the son of Jether, that he killed them, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put innocent blood on his girdle that was about his loins, and on his sandal that was on his foot.
6. Therefore you shall deal with him according to your wisdom, and you shall not bring down his grey hairs in peace to the grave.
7. But you shall deal kindly with the sons of Berzelli the Galaadite, and they shall be among those that eat at your table; for thus they drew near to me when I fled from the face of your brother Abessalom.
8. And, behold, there is with you Semei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Baurim: and he cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went into the camp; and he came down to Jordan to meet me, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, I will not put you to death with the sword.
9. But you shall by no means hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man, and will know what you shall do to him, and shall bring down his grey hairs with blood to the grave.
10. And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.
11. And the days which David reigned over Israel were forty years; he reigned seven years in Chebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
12. And Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was established greatly.
13. And Adonias the son of Aggith came in to Bersabee the mother of Solomon, and did obeisance to her: and she said, Do you enter peaceably? and he said, Peaceably:
14. I have business with you. And she said to him, Say on.
15. And he said to her, You know that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel turned their face toward me for a king; but the kingdom was turned from me and became my brother's: for it was appointed to him from the Lord.
16. And now I make one request of you, do not turn away your face. And Bersabee said to him, Speak on.
17. And he said to her, Speak, I pray you, to king Solomon, for he will not turn away his face from you, and let him give me Abisag the Somanite for a wife.
18. And Bersabee said, Well; I will speak for you to the king.
19. And Bersabee went in to king Solomon to speak to him concerning Adonias; and the king rose up to meet her, and kissed her, and sat on the throne, and a throne was set for the mother of the king, and she sat on his right hand.
20. And she said to him, I ask of you one little request; turn not away my face from you. And the king said to her, Ask, my mother, and I will not reject you.
21. And she said, Let, I pray you, Abisag the Somanite be given to Adonias your brother to wife.
22. And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why have you asked Abisag for Adonias? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother, and he has for his companion Abiathar the priest, and Joab the son of Saruia the commander-in-chief.
23. And king Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if it be not that Adonias has spoken this word against his own life.
24. And now as the Lord lives who has established me, and set me on the throne of my father David, and he has made me a house, as the Lord spoke, this day shall Adonias be put to death.
25. So king Solomon sent by the hand of Banaeas the son of Jodae, and he killed him, and Adonias died in that day.
26. And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Depart you quickly to Anathoth to your farm, for you are worthy of death this day; but I will not kill you, because you have borne the ark of the covenant of the Lord before my father, and because you was afflicted in all things wherein my father was afflicted.
27. And Solomon removed Abiathar from being a priest of the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning the house of Heli in Selom.
28. And the report came to Joab son of Saruia; for Joab had turned after Adonias, and he went not after Solomon: and Joab fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.
29. And it was told Solomon, saying, Joab has fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and behold! he has hold of the horns of the altar. And king Solomon sent to Joab, saying, What ails you, that you have fled to the altar? and Joab said, Because I was afraid of you, and fled for refuge to the Lord. And Solomon sent Banaeas son of Jodae, saying, Go and kill him, and bury him.
30. And Banaeas son of Jodae came to Joab to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And Joab said, I will not come forth, for I will die here. And Banaeas son of Jodae returned and spoke to the king, saying, Thus has Joab spoken, and thus has he answered me.
31. And the king said to him, Go, and do to him as he has spoken, and kill him: and you shall bury him, and you shall remove this day the blood which he shed without cause, from me and from the house of my father.
32. And the Lord has returned upon his own head the blood of his unrighteousness, inasmuch as he attacked two men more righteous and better than himself, and killed them with the sword, and my father David knew not of their blood, even Abenner the son of Ner the commander-in-chief of Israel, and Amessa the son of Jether the commander-in-chief of Juda.
33. And their blood is returned upon his head, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but to David, and his seed, and his house, and his throne, may there be peace for ever from the Lord.
34. So Banaeas son of Jodae went up, and attacked him, and killed him, and buried him in his house in the wilderness.
35. And the king appointed Banaeas son of Jodae in his place over the host; and the kingdom was established in Jerusalem; and as for Sadoc the priest, the king appointed him to be high priest in the room of Abiathar. And Solomon son of David reigned over Israel and Juda in Jerusalem: and the Lord gave understanding to Solomon, and very much wisdom, and largeness of heart, as the sand by the sea-shore.
** 3
1. And the wisdom of Solomon abounded exceedingly beyond the wisdom of all the ancients, and beyond all the wise men of Egypt: and he took the daughter of Pharao, and brought her into the city of David, until he had finished building his own house, and the house of the Lord first, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. In seven years he made and finished them.
And Solomon had seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eight thousand hewers of stone in the mountain: and Solomon made the sea, and the bases, and the great lavers, and the pillars, and the fountain of the court, and the brazen sea— and he built the citadel as a defence above it, he made a breach in the wall of the city of David: thus the daughter of Pharao went up out of the city of David to her house which he built for her. Then he built the citadel: and Solomon offered up three whole burnt offerings in the year, and peace-offerings on the altar which he built to the Lord, and he burnt incense before the Lord, and finished the house. And these are the chief persons who presided over the works of Solomon; three thousand and six hundred masters of the people that wrought the works. And he burit Assur, and Magdo, and Gazer, and upper Baethoron, and Ballath: only after he had built the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about, afterwards he built these cities.
And when David was yet living, he charged Solomon, saying, Behold, there is with you Semei the son of Gera, of the seed of Benjamin out of Chebron: he cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went into the camp; and he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, He shall not be slain with the sword. But now do not you hold him guiltless, for you are a man of understanding, and you will know what you shall do to him, and you shall bring down his grey hairs with blood to the grave.
And. the king called Semei, and said to him, Build you a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and you shall not go out thence any whither.
And. it shall come to pass in the day that you shall go forth and cross over the brook Kedron, know assuredly that you shall certainly die: your blood shall be upon your head. And the king caused him to swear in that day.
And. Semei said to the king, Good is the word that you have spoken, my lord O king: thus will your servant do. And Semei lived in Jerusalem three years.
And. it came to pass after the three years, that two servants of Semei ran away to Anchus son of Maacha king of Geth: and it was told Semei, saying, Behold, your servants are in Geth.
And. Semei rose up, and saddled his ass, and went to Geth to Anchus to seek out his servants: and Semei went, and brought his servants out of Geth.
And. it was told Solomon, saying, Semei is gone out of Jerusalem to Geth, and has brought back his servants.
And. the king sent and called Semei, and said to him, Did I not adjure you by the Lord, and testify to you, saying, In whatever day you shall go out of Jerusalem, and go to the right or left, know certainly that you shall assuredly die?
And. why have you not kept the oath of the Lord, and the commandment which I commanded you?
And. the king said to Semei, You know all your mischief which your heart knows, which you did to David my father: and the Lord has recompensed your mischief on your own head.
And. king Solomon is blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord for ever.
And. Solomon commanded Banaeas the son of Jodae, and he went forth and killed him.
And king Solomon was very prudent and wise: and Juda and Israel were very many, as the sand which is by the sea for multitude, eating, and drinking, and rejoicing: and Solomon was chief in all the kingdoms, and they brought gifts, and served Solomon all the days of his life. And Solomon began to open the domains of Libanus, and he built Thermae in the wilderness. And this was the daily provision of Solomon, thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of ground meal, ten choice calves, and twenty oxen from the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides stags, and does, and choice fed birds. For he ruled in all the country on this side the river, from Raphi to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the river: and he was at peace on all sides round about; and Juda and Israel lived safely, every one under his vine and under his fig tree, eating and drinand feasting, from Dan even to Bersabee, all the days of Solomon.
And these were the princes of Solomon; Azariu son of Sadoc the priest, and Orniu son of Nathan chief of the officers, and he went to his house; and Suba the scribe, and Basa son of Achithalam recorder, and Abi son of Joab commander-in-chief, and Achire son of Edrai was over the levies, and Banaeas son of Jodae over the household and over the brick work, and Cachur the son of Nathan was counsellor.
And Solomon had forty thousand brood mares for his chariots, and twelve thousand horses. And he reigned over all the kings from the river and to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt: so Solomon the son of David reigned over Israel and Juda in Jerusalem.
2. Nevertheless the people burnt incense on the high places, because a house had not yet been built to the Lord.
3. And Solomon loved the Lord, so as to walk in the ordinances of David his father; only he sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places.
4. And he arose and went to Gabaon to sacrifice there, for that was the highest place, and great: Solomon offered a whole burnt offering of a thousand victims on the altar in Gabaon.
5. And the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and the Lord said to Solomon, Ask some petition for yourself.
6. And Solomon said, You have dealt very mercifully with your servant David my father according as he walked before you in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with you, and you have kept for him this great mercy, to set his son upon his throne,  as it is this day.
7. And now, O Lord my God, you have appointed your servant in the room of David my father; and I am a little child, and know not my going out an my coming in.
8. But your servant is in the midst of your people, whom you have chosen, a great people, which as this day can’t be numbered.
9. You shall give therefore to your servant a heart to hear and to judge your people justly, and to discern between good and evil: for who will be able to judge this your great people?
10. And it was pleasing before the Lord, that Solomon asked this thing.
11. And the Lord said to him, Because you have asked this thing of me, and have not asked for yourself long life, and have not asked wealth, nor have asked the lives of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to hear judgment;
12. behold, I have done according to your word: behold, I have given you an understanding and wise heart: there has not been any one like you before you, and after you there shall not arise one like you.
13. And I have given you what you have not asked, wealth and glory, so that there has not been any one like you among kings.
14. And if you will walk in my way, to keep my commandments and my ordinances, as David your father walked, then will I multiply your days.
15. And Solomon awoke, and, behold, it was a dream: and he arose and came to Jerusalem, and stood before the altar that was in front of the ark of the covenant of the Lord in Sion: and he offered whole burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings, and made a great banquet for himself and all his servants.
16. Then there appeared two harlots before the king, and they stood before him.
17. And the one woman said, Hear me, my lord; I and this woman lived in one house, and we were delivered in the house.
18. And it came to pass on the third day after I was delivered, this woman also was delivered: and we were together; and there was no one with us besides our two selves in the house.
19. And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.
20. and she arose in the middle of the night, and took my son from my arms, and laid him in her bosom, and laid her dead son in my bosom.
21. and I arose in the morning to suckle my son, and he was dead: and, behold, I considered him in the morning, and, behold, it was not my son whom I bore.
22. And the other woman said, No, but the living is my son, and the dead is your son. So they spoke before the king.
23. and the king said to them, You say, This is my son, even the living one, and this woman's son is the dead one: and you say, No, but the living is my son, and the dead is your son.
24. And the king said, Fetch a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
25. And the king said, Divide the live child, the suckling, in two; and give half of it to one, and half of it to the other.
26. And the woman whose the living child was, answered and said to the king, (for her bowels yearned over her son) and she said, I pray you, my lord, give her the child, and in nowise kill it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor hers; divide it.
27. Then the king answered and said, Give the child to her that said, 'Give it to her, and by no means kill it:' she is its mother.
28. and all Israel heard this judgment which the king judged, and they feared before the king; because they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to execute judgment.
** 4
1. And king Solomon reigned over Israel.
2. And these are the princes which he had; Azarias son of Sadoc.
3. Eliaph, and Achia son of Seba, scribes; and Josaphat son of Achilud, recorder.
4. And Banaeas son of Jodae over the host; and Sadoc and Abiathar were priests.
5. And Ornia the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabuth son of Nathan was the king's friend.
6. And Achisar was steward, and Eliac the chief steward; and Eliab the son of Saph was over the family: and Adoniram the son of Audon over the tribute.
7. And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, to provide for the king and his household; each one's turn came to supply for a month in the year.
8. And these were their names: Been the son of Or in the mount of Ephraim, one.
9. The son of Dacar, in Makes, and in Salabin, and Baethsamys, and Elon as far as Bethanan, one.
10. The son of Esdi in Araboth; his was Socho, and all the land of Opher.
11. All Nephthador belonged to the son of Aminadab, Tephath daughter of Solomon was his wife, one.
12. Bana son of Achiluth had Ithaanach, and Mageddo, and his was the whole house of San which was by Sesathan below Esrae, and from Bethsan as far as Sabelmaula, as far as Maeber Lucam, one.
13. The son of Naber in Raboth Galaad, to him fell the lot of Ergab in Basan, sixty great cities with walls, and brazen bars, one.
14. Achinadab son of Saddo, had Maanaim.
15. Achimaas was in Nephthalim, and he took Basemmath daughter of Solomon to wife, one.
16. Baana son of Chusi, in Aser and in Baaloth, one,
17. Josaphat son of Phuasud was in Issachar.
18. Semei son of Ela, in Benjamin.
19. Gaber son of Adai in the land of Gad, the land of Seon king of Esebon, and of Og king of Basan, and one officer in the land of Juda.
20. And. thus the officers provided king Solomon: and they execute every one in his month all the orders for the table of the king, they omit nothing.
21. And. they carried the barley and the straw for the horses and the chariots to the place where the king might be, each according to his charge.
22. And these were the requisite supplies for Solomon: in one day thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of fine pounded meal,
23. and ten choice calves, and twenty pastured oxen, and a hundred sheep, besides stags, and choice fatted does.
24. For he had dominion on this side the river, and he was at peace on all sides round about.
29. And the Lord gave understanding to Solomon, and very much wisdom, and enlargement of heart, as the sand on the seashore.
30. And Solomon abounded greatly beyond the wisdom of all the ancients, and beyond all the wise men of Egypt.
31. And he was wiser than all other men: and he was wiser than Gaethan the Zarite, and than Aenan, and than Chalcad and Darala the son of Mal.
32. And Solomon spoke three thousand proverbs, and his songs were five thousand.
33. And he spoke of trees, from the cedar in Libanus even to the hyssop which comes out through the wall: he spoke also of cattle, and of birds, and of reptiles, and of fishes.
34. And all the nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and ambassadors from all the kings of the earth, as many as heard of his wisdom.
And Solomon took to himself the daughter of Pharao to wife, and brought her into the city of David until he had finished the house of the Lord, and his own house, and the wall of Jerusalem. Then went up Pharao the king of Egypt, and took Gazer, and burnt it and the Chananite dwelling in Mergab; and Pharao gave them as a dowry to his daughter the wife of Solomon: and Solomon rebuilt Gazer.
** 5
1. And Chiram king of Tyre sent his servants to anoint Solomon in the room of David his father, because Chiram always loved David.
2. And Solomon sent to Chiram, saying,
3. You knew my father David, that he could not build a house to the name of the Lord my God because of the wars that compassed him about, until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet.
4. And now the Lord my God has given me rest round about; there is no one plotting against me, and there is no evil trespass against me.
5. And, behold, I intend to build a house to the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord God spoke to my father David, saying, Your son whom I will set on your throne in your place, he shall build a house to my name.
6. And now command, and let men cut wood for me out of Libanus: and, behold, my servants shall be with your servants, and I will give you the wages of your service, according to all that you shall say, because you know that we have no one skilled in cutting timber like the Sidonians.
7. And it came to pass, as soon as Chiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be God today, who has given to David a wise son over this numerous people.
8. And he sent to Solomon, saying, I have listened concerning all that you have sent to me for: I will do all your will: as for timber of cedar and fir,
9. my servants shall bring them down from Libanus to the sea: I will form them into rafts, and bring them to the place which you shall send to me about; and I will land them there, and you shall take them up: and you shall do my will, in giving bread to my household.
10. So Chiram gave to Solomon cedars, and fir trees, and all his desire.
11. And Solomon gave to Chiram twenty thousand measures of wheat as food for his house, and twenty thousand baths of beaten oil thus Solomon gave to Chiram yearly.
12. And the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon as he promised him; and there was peace between Chiram and Solomon, and they made a covenant between them.
13. And the king raised a levy out of all Israel, and the levy was thirty thousand men.
14. And he sent them to Libanus, ten thousand taking turn every month: they were a month in Libanus and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.
15. And Solomon had seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand hewers of stone in the mountain;
16. besides the rulers that were appointed over the works of Solomon, there were three thousand six hundred masters who wrought in the works.
17. And the king commanded and they brought great stones, precious stones for the foundation of the house, and unhewn stones.
18. And they prepared the stones and the timber during three years.
** 6
1. And it came to pass in the four hundred and forties year after the departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt, in the fourth year and second month of the reign of king Solomon over Israel,
that. the king commanded that they should take great and costly stones for the foundation of the house, and hewn stones.
And. the men of Solomon, and the men of Chiram hewed the stones, and laid them for a foundation. In the fourth year he laid the foundation of the house of the Lord, in the month Ziu, even in the second month. In the eleventh year, in the month Baal, this is the eighth month, the house was completed according to all its plan, and according to all its arrangement.
2. And the house which the king built to the Lord was forty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and its height five and twenty cubits.
3. And the porch in front of the temple—twenty cubits was its length according to the breadth of the house in front of the house: and he built the house, and finished it.
4. And he made to the house secret windows inclining inward.
5. And against the wall of the house he set chambers round about the temple and the ark.
6. The under side was five cubits broad, and the middle part six, and the third was seven cubits broad; for he formed an interval to the house round about without the house, that they might not touch the walls of the house.
7. And the house was built in the construction of it with rough hewn stones: and there was not heard in the house in the building of it hammer or axe, or any iron tool.
8. And the porch of the under side was below the right wing of the house, and there was a winding ascent into the middle chamber, and from the middle to the third story.
9. So he built the house and finished it; and he made the ceiling of the house with cedars.
10 And he made the partitions through all the house, each five cubits high, and enclosed each partition with cedar boards.
15. And he framed the walls of the house within with cedar boards, from the floor of the house and on to the inner walls and to the beams: he lined the parts enclosed with boards within, and compassed the inward parts of the house with planks of fir.
16. And he built the twenty cubits from the top of the wall, one side from the floor to the beams, and he made it from the oracle to the most holy place.
17. And the temple was forty cubits in extent,
19. in front of the oracle in the midst of the house within, in order to put there the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
20. The length was twenty cubits, and the breadth was twenty cubits, and the height of it was twenty cubits. And he covered it with perfect gold, and he made an altar in front of the oracle, and covered it with gold.
21. And he covered the whole house with gold, till he had finished gilding the whole house.
23. And he made in the oracle two cherubs of ten cubits measured size.
24. And the wing of one cherub was five cubits, and his other wing was five cubits; ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other wing.
25. Thus it was with the other cherub, both were alike finished with one measure.
26. And the height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it with the second cherub.
27. And both the cherubs were in the midst of the innermost part of the house; and they spread out their wings, and one wing touched the wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings in the midst of the house touched each other.
28. And he covered the cherubs with gold.
29. He graved all the walls of the house round about with the graving of cherubs, and he sculptured palm trees within and without the house.
30. And he covered the floor of the house within and without with gold.
31. And for the door-way of the oracle he made doors of juniper wood, there were porches in a four-fold way.
34. In both the doors were planks of fir; the one door had two leaves and their hinges, and the other door had two leaves and turned on hinges,
35. being carved with cherubs, and there were palm-trees and open flower-leaves, and it was overlaid with gold gilt upon the engraving.
36. And he built the inner court, three rows of hewn stones, and a row of wrought cedar round about, and he made the curtain of the court of the porch of the house that was in front of the temple.

.1-12

13. And king Solomon sent, and took Chiram out of Tyre,
14. the son of a widow woman; and he was of the tribe of Nephthalim, and his father was a Tyrian; a worker in brass, and accomplished in are and skill and knowledge to work every work in brass: and he was brought in to king Solomon, and he wrought all the works.
15. And he cast the two pillars for the porch of the house: eighteen cubits was the height of each pillar, and a circumference of fourteen cubits encompassed it, even the thickness of the pillar: the flutings were four fingers wide, and thus was the other pillar formed.
16. And he made two molten chapiters to put on the heads of the pillars: five cubits was the height of one chapiter, and five cubits was the height of the other chapiter.
17. And he made two ornaments of network to cover the chapiters of the pillars; even a net for one chapiter, and a net for the other chapiter.
18. And hanging work, two rows of brazen pomegranates, formed with network, hanging work, row upon row: and thus he framed the ornaments for the second chapiter. And. he set up the pillars of the porch of the temple: and he set up the one pillar, and called its name Jachum: and he set up the second pillar, and called its name Boloz.
19. And on the heads of the pillars he made lily-work against the porch, of four cubits,
20. and a chamber over both the pillars, and above the sides an addition equal to the chamber in width.
23. And he made the sea, ten cubits from one rim to the other, the same was completely circular round about: its height was five cubits, and its circumference thirty-three cubits.
24. And stays underneath its rim round about compassed it ten cubits round;
25. And there were twelve oxen under the sea: three looking to the north, and three looking to the west, and three looking to the south, and three looking to the east: and all their hinder parts were inward, and the sea was above upon them.
26. and its rim was as the work of the rim of a cup, a lily-flower, and the thickness of it was a span.
27. And he made ten brazen bases: five cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth of it, and its height was six cubits.
28. And this work of the bases was formed with a border the them, and there was a border between the ledges.
29. And upon their borders between the projection were lions, and oxen, and cherubs: and on the projections, even so above, and also below were the places of lions and oxen, hanging work.
30. And there were four brazen wheels to one base; and there were brazen bases, and their four sides answering to them, side pieces under the bases.
31. And there were axles in the wheels under the base.
32. And the height of one wheel was a cubit and a half.
33. And the work of the wheels was as the work of chariot wheels: their axles, and their felloes, and the rest of their work, were all molten.
34. The four side pieces were at the four corners of each base; its shoulders were formed of the base.
35. And on the top of the base half a cubit was the size of it, there was a circle on the top of the base, and there was the top of its spaces and its borders: and it was open at the top of its spaces.
36. And its borders were cherubs, and lions, and palm-trees, upright, each was joined in front and within and round about.
37. According to the same form he made all the ten bases, even one order and one measure to all.
38. And he made ten brazen lavers, each laver containing forty baths, and measuring four cubits, each laver placed on a several base throughout the ten bases.
39. And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and the sea was placed on the right side of the house eastward in the direction of the south.
40. And Chiram made the caldrons, and the pans, and the bowls; and Chiram finished making all the works that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of the Lord:
41. two pillars and the wreathen works of the pillars on the heads of the two pillars; and the two networks to cover both the wreathen works of the flutings that were upon the pillars.
42. The four hundred pomegranates for both the networks, two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover both the wreathen works of the bases belonging to both pillars.
43. And the ten bases, and the ten lavers upon the bases.
44. And one sea, and the twelve oxen under the sea.
45. And the caldrons, and pans, and bowls, and all the furniture, which Chiram made for king Solomon for the house of the Lord: and there were eight and forty pillars of the house of the king and of the house of the Lord: all the works of the king which Chiram made were entirely of brass.
47. There was no reckoning of the brass of which he made all these works, from the very great abundance, there was no end of the weight of the brass.
46. In. the country round about Jordan did he cast them, in the of the land. clay land between Socchoth and Sira.
48. And king Solomon took the furniture which Chiram made for the house of the Lord, the golden altar, and the golden table of show bread.
49. And he put the five candlesticks on the left, and five on the right in front of the oracle, being of pure gold, and the lamp-stands, and the lamps, and the snuffers of gold.
50. And there were made the porches, and the nails, and the bowls, and the spoons, and the golden censers, of pure gold: and the panels of the doors of the innermost part of the house, even the holy of holies, and the golden doors of the temple.
51. So the work of the house of the Lord which Solomon wrought was finished; and Solomon brought in the holy things of David his father, and all the holy things of Solomon; he put the silver, and the gold, and the furniture, into the treasures of the house of the Lord.
** 8
1. And it came to pass when Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord and his own house after twenty years, then king Solomon assembled all the elders of Israel in Sion, to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, this is Sion,
2. in the month of Athanin.
3. And the priests took up the ark,
4. and the tabernacle of testimony, and the holy furniture that was in the tabernacle of testimony.
5. And the king and all Israel were occupied before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, without number.
6. And the priests bring in the ark into its place, into the oracle of the house, even into the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubs.
7. For the cherubs spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubs covered the ark and its holy things above.
8. And the holy staves projected, and the ends of the holy staves appeared out of the holy places in front of the oracle, and were not seen without.
9. There was nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant which Moses put there in Choreb, which tables the Lord made as a covenant with the children of Israel in their going forth from the land of Egypt.
10. And it came to pass when the priests departed out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house.
11. And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, because the glory of the Lord filled the house.
14. And the king turned his face, and the king blessed all Israel, (and the whole assembly of Israel stood:)
15. and he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel today, who spoke by his mouth concerning David my father, and has fulfilled it with his hands, saying,
16. From the day that I brought out my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any one tribe of Israel to build a house, so that my name should be there: but I chose Jerusalem that my name should be there, and I chose David to be over my people Israel.
17. And it was in the heart of my father to build a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel.
18. And the Lord said to David my father, Forasmuch as it came into your heart to build a house to my name, you did well that it came upon your heart.
19. Nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son that has proceeded out of your bowels, he shall build the house to my name.
20. And the Lord has confirmed the word that he spoke, and I am risen up in the place of my father David, and I have sat down on the throne of Israel, as the Lord spoke, and I have built the house to the name of the Lord God of Israel.
21. And I have set there a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord, which the Lord made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
22. And Solomon stood up in front of the altar before all the congregation of Israel; and he spread out his hands toward heaven:
23. and he said, Lord God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above and on the earth beneath, keeping covenant and mercy with your servant who walks before you with all his heart;
24. which you have kept toward your servant David my father: for you have spoken by your mouth and you have fulfilled it with your hands, as at this day.
25. And now, O Lord God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father, the promises which you have spoken to him, saying, There shall not be taken from you a man sitting before me on the throne of Israel, provided only your children shall take heed to their ways, to walk before me as you have walked before me.
26. And now, O Lord God of Israel, let, I pray you, your word to David my father be confirmed.
27. But will God indeed dwell with men upon the earth? if the heaven and heaven of heavens will not suffice you, how much less even this house which I have built to your name?
28. Yet, O Lord God of Israel, you shall look upon my petition, to hear the prayer which your servant prays to you in your presence this day,
29. that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place which you said, My name shall be there, to hear the prayer which your servant prays at this place day and night.
30. And you shall listen to the prayer of your servant, and of your people Israel, which they shall pray toward this place; and you shall hear in your dwelling-place in heaven, and you shall do and be gracious.
31. Whatsoever trespasses any one shall commit against his neighbor,—and if he shall take upon him an oath so that he should swear, and he shall come and make confession before your altar in this house,
32. then shall you hear from heaven, and do, and you shall judge your people Israel, that the wicked should be condemned, to recompense his way upon his head; and to justify the righteous, to give to him according to his righteousness.
33. When your people Israel falls before enemies, because they shall sin against you, and they shall return and confess to your name, and they shall pray and supplicate in this house,
34. then shall you hear from heaven, and be gracious to the sins of your people Israel, and you shall restore them to the land which you gave to their fathers.
35. When the heaven is restrained, and there is no rain, because they shall sin against you, and the shall pray toward this place, and they shall make confession to your name, and shall turn from their sins when you shall have humbled them,
36. then you shall hear from heaven, and be merciful to the sins of your servant and of your people Israel; for you shall show them the good way to walk in it, and you shall give rain upon the earth which you have given to your people for an inheritance.
37. If there should be famine, if there should be death, because there should be blasting, locust, or if there be mildew, and if their enemy oppress them in any one of their cities, with regard to every calamity, every trouble,
38. every prayer, every supplication whatever shall be made by any man, as they shall know each the plague of his heart, and shall spread abroad his hands to this house,
39. then shall you listen from heaven, out of your established dwelling-place, and shall be merciful, and shall do, and recompense to every man according to his ways, as you shall know his heart, for you alone know the heart of all the children of men:
40. that they may fear you all the days that they live upon the land, which you have given to our fathers.
41. And for the stranger who is not of your people,
42. when they shall come and pray toward this place,
43. then shall you hear them from heaven, out of your established dwelling-place, and you shall do according to all that the stranger shall call upon you for, that all the nations may know your name, and fear you, as do your people Israel, and may know that your name has been called on this house which I have builded.
44. If it be that your people shall go forth to war against their enemies in the way by which you shall turn them, and pray in the name of the Lord toward the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built to your name,
45. then shall you hear from heaven their supplication and their prayer, and shall execute judgment for them.
46. If it be that they shall sin against you, (for there is not a man who will not sin,) and you shall bring them and deliver them up before their enemies, and they that take them captive shall carry them to a land far or near,
47. and they shall turn their hearts in the land whither they have been carried captives, and turn in the land of their sojourning, and supplicate you, saying, We have sinned, we have done unjustly, we have transgressed,
48. and they shall turn to you with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies whither you have carried them captives, and shall pray to you toward their land which you have given to their fathers, and the city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built to your name:
49. then shall you hear from heaven your established dwelling-place,
50. and you shall be merciful to their unrighteousness wherein they have trespassed against you, and according to all their transgressions wherewith they have transgressed against you, and you shall cause them to be pitied before them that carried them captives, and they shall have compassion on them:
51. for they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt, out of the midst of the furnace of iron.
52. And let your eyes and your ears be opened to the supplication of your servant, and to the supplication of your people Israel, to listen to them in all things for which they shall call upon you.
53. Because you have set them apart for an inheritance to yourself out of all the nations of the earth, as you spoke by the hand of your servant Moses, when you brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, O Lord God.—Then spoke Solomon concerning the house, when he had finished building it—He manifested the sun in the heaven: the Lord said he would dwell in darkness: build you my house, a beautiful house for yourself to dwell in anew. Behold, is not this written in the book of the song?
54. And it came to pass when Solomon had finished praying to the Lord all this prayer and supplication, that he rose up from before the altar of the Lord, after having knelt upon his knees, and his hands were spread out towards heaven.
55. And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
56. Blessed be the Lord this day, who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he said: there has not failed one word among all his good words which he spoke by the hand of his servant Moses.
57. May the Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers; let him not desert us nor turn from us,
58. that he may turn our hearts toward him to walk in all his ways, and to keep all his commandments, and his ordinances which he commanded our fathers.
59. And let these words, which I have prayed before the Lord our God, be near to the Lord our God day and night, to maintain the cause of your servant, and the cause of your people Israel for ever.
60. that all the nations of the earth may know that the Lord God, he is God, and there is none beside.
61. And let our hearts be perfect toward the Lord our God, to walk also holily in his ordinances, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
62. And the king and all the children of Israel offered sacrifice before the Lord.
63. And king Solomon offered for the sacrifices of peace-offering which he sacrificed to the Lord, two and twenty thousand oxen, and hundred and twenty thousand sheep: and the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord.
64. In that day the king consecrated the middle of the court in the front of the house of the Lord; for there he offered the whole burnt offering, and the sacrifices, and the fat of the peace-offerings, because the brazen altar which was before the Lord was too little to bear the whole burnt offering and the sacrifices of peace-offerings.
65. And Solomon kept the feast in that day, and all Israel with him, even a great assembly from the entering in of Hemath to the river of Egypt, before the Lord our God in the house which he built, eating and drinking, and rejoicing before the Lord our God seven days.
66. And on the eighth day he sent away the people: and they blessed the king, and each departed to his tabernacle rejoicing, and their heart was glad because of the good things which the Lord had done to his servant David, and to Israel his people.
** 9
1. And it came to pass when Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all the work of Solomon, whatever he wished to perform,
2. that the Lord appeared to Solomon a second time, as he appeared in Gabaon.
3. And the Lord said to him, I have heard the voice of your prayer, and your supplication which you made before me: I have done for you according to all your prayer: I have hallowed this house which you have built to put my name there for ever, and my eyes and my heart shall be there always.
4. And if you will walk before me as David your father walked, in holiness of heart and uprightness, and so as to do according to all that I commanded him, and shall keep my ordinances and my commandments:
5. then will I establish the throne of your kingdom in Israel for ever, as I spoke to David your father, saying, There shall not fail you a man to rule in Israel.
6. But if you° or your children do in any wise revolt from me, and do not keep my commandments and my ordinances, which Moses set before you, and you° go and serve other gods, and worship them:
7. then will I cut off Israel from the land which I have given them, and this house which I have consecrated to my name I will cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a desolation and a byword to all nations.
8. And this house, which is high, shall be so that every one that passes by it shall be amazed, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Therefore has the Lord done thus to this land, and to this house?
9. And men shall say, Because they forsook the Lord their God, who brought out their fathers from Egypt, out of the house of bondage, and they attached themselves to strange gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore the Lord has brought this evil upon them. Then Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharao out of the city of David into his house which he built for himself in those days.
10. During twenty years in which Solomon was building the two houses, the house of the Lord, and the house of the king,
11. Chiram king of Tyre helped Solomon with cedar wood, and fir wood, and with gold, and all that he wished for: then the king gave Chiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
12. So Chiram departed from Tyre, and went into Galilee to see the cities which Solomon gave to him; and they pleased him not. And he said,
13. What are these cities which you have given me, brother? And he called them Boundary until this day.
14. And Chiram brought to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold,
26. even that for which king Solomon built a ship in Gasion Gaber near Aelath on the shore of the extremity of the sea in the land of Edom.
27. And Chiram sent in the ship together with the servants of Solomon servants of his own, mariners to row, men acquainted with the sea.
28. And they came to Sophira, and took thence a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.
** 10
1. And the queen of Saba heard of the name of Solomon, and the name of the Lord, and she came to try him with riddles.
2. And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train; and there came camels bearing spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and she came in to Solomon, and told him all that was in her heart.
3. And Solomon answered all her questions: and there was not a question overlooked by the king which he did not answer her.
4. And the queen of Saba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he built,
5. and the provision of Solomon and the sitting of his attendants, and the standing of his servants, and his raiment, and his cupbearers, and his whole burnt offering which he offered in the house of the Lord, and she was utterly amazed.
6. And she said to king Solomon, It was a true report which I heard in my land of your words and your wisdom.
7. But I believed not them that told me, until I came and my eyes saw: and, behold, the words as they reported to me are not the half: you have exceeded in goodness all the report which I heard in my land.
8. Blessed are your wives, blessed are these your servants who stand before you continually, who hear all your wisdom.
9. Blessed be the Lord your God, who has taken pleasure in you, to set you upon the throne of Israel, because the Lord loved Israel to establish him for ever; and he has made you king over them, to execute judgment with justice, and in their causes.
10. And she gave to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and very many spices, and precious stones: there had not come any other spices so abundant as those which the queen of Saba gave to king Solomon.
11. And the ship of Chiram which brought the gold from Suphir, brought very much hewn timber and precious stones.
12. And the king made the hewn timber into buttresses of the house of the Lord and the king's house, and lyres and harps for singers: such hewn timber had not come upon the earth, nor have been seen anywhere until this day.
13. And king Solomon gave to the queen of Saba all that she desired, whatever she asked, besides all that he had given her by the hand of king Solomon: and she returned, and came into her own land, she and her servants.
14. And the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold.
15. Besides the tributes of them that were subjects, both merchants and all the kings of the country beyond the river, and of the princess of the land.
16. And Solomon made three hundred spears of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold were upon one spear.
17. And three hundred shields of beaten gold: and three pounds of gold were in one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
18. And the king made a great ivory throne, and gilded it with pure gold.
19. The throne had six steps, and calves in bold relief to the throne behind it, and side-pieces on either hand of the place of the seat, and two lions standing by the side-pieces,
20. and twelve lions standing there on the six steps on either side: it was not so done in any other kingdom.
21. And all the vessels made by Solomon were of gold, and the lavers were golden, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; there was no silver, for it was not accounted of in the days of Solomon.
22. For Solomon had a ship of Tharsis in the sea with the ships of Chiram: one ship came to the king every three years out of Tharsis, laden with gold and silver, and wrought stones, and hewn stones.
This was the arrangement of the provision which king Solomon fetched to build the house of the Lord, and the house of the king, and the wall of Jerusalem, and the citadel; to fortify the city of David, and Assur, and Magdal, and Gazer, and Baethoron the upper, and Jethermath, and all the cities of the chariots, and all the cities of the horsemen, and the fortification of Solomon which he purposed to build in Jerusalem and in all the land, so that none of the people should rule over him that was left of the Chettite and the Amorite, and the Pherezite, and the Chananite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Gergesite, who were not of the children of Israel, their descendants who had been left with him in the land, whom the children of Israel could not utterly destroy; and Solomon made them tributaries until this day. But of the children of Israel Solomon made nothing; for they were the warriors, and his servants and rulers, and captains of the third order, and the captains of his chariots, and his horsemen.
23. And Solomon increased beyond all the kings of the earth in wealth and wisdom.
24. And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which the Lord had put into his heart.
25. And they brought every one their gifts, vessels of gold, and raiment, and stacte, and spices, and horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
26. And Solomon had four thousand mares for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he put them in the cities of his chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem: and he ruled over all the kings from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt.
27. And the king made gold and silver in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as the sycamores in the plain for multitude.
28. And the goings forth of Solomon's horsemen was also out of Egypt, and the king's merchants were of Thecue; and they received them out of Thecue at a price.
29. And that which proceeded out of Egypt went up thus, even a chariot for a hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for fifty shekels of silver: and thus for all the kings of the Chettians, and the kings of Syria, they came out by sea.
** 11
1. And king Solomon was a lover of women.
.3) And. he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines.
.1) And. he took strange women, as well as the daughter of Pharao, Moabitish, Ammanitish women, Syrians and Idumeans, Chettites, and Amorites;
.2-3 of the nations concerning whom the Lord forbade the children of Israel, saying, You° shall not go in to them, and they shall not come in to you, lest they turn away your hearts after their idols: Solomon clave to these in love.
4. And it came to pass in the time of the old age of Solomon, that his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father.
3. And. the strange women turned away his heart after their gods. 7. Then. Solomon built a high place to Chamos the idol of Moab, and to their king the idol of the children of Ammon,

5. and to Astarte the abomination of the Sidonians.
.6-8 And thus he acted towards all his strange wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their idols.
6. And. Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he went not after the Lord, as David his father.
9. And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because he turned away his heart from the Lord God of Israel, who had appeared twice to him,
10. and charged him concerning this matter, by no means to go after other gods, but to take heed to do what the Lord God commanded him; neither was his heart perfect with the Lord, according to the heart of David his father.
11. And the Lord said to Solomon, Because it has been thus with you, and you have not kept my commandments and my ordinances which I commanded you, I will surely rend your kingdom out of your hand, and give it to your servant.
12. Only in your days I will not do it for David your father's sake: but I will take it out of the hand of your son.
13. Only I will not take away the whole kingdom: I will give one tribe to your son for David my servant's sake, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen.
14. And the Lord raised up an enemy to Solomon, Ader the Idumaean, and Esrom son of Eliadae who lived in Raama, and Adadezer king of Suba his master; (and men gathered to him, and he was head of the conspiracy, and he seized on Damasec,) and they were adversaries to Israel all the days of Solomon: and Ader the Idumaean was of the seed royal in Idumaea.
15. And it happened, that while David was utterly destroying Edom, while Joab captain of the host was going to bury the dead, when they killed every male in Idumaea;
16. (for Joab and all Israel abode there six months in Idumaea, until he utterly destroyed every male in Idumaea;)
17. that Ader ran away, he and all the Idumaeans of the servants of his father with him; and they went into Egypt; and Ader was then a little child.
18. And there rise up men out of the city of Madiam, and they come to Pharan, and take men with them, and come to Pharao king of Egypt: and Ader went in to Pharao, and he gave him a house, and appointed him provision.
19. And Ader found great favor in the sight of Pharao, and he gave him his wife's sister in marriage, the elder sister of Thekemina.
20. And the sister of Thekemina bore to him, even to Ader, Ganebath her son; and Thekemina brought him up in the midst of the sons of Pharao, and Ganebath was in the midst of the sons of Pharao.
21. And Ader heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead; and Ader said to Pharao, Let me go, and I will return to my country.
22. And Pharao said to Ader, What lack you with me? that behold! you seek to depart to your country? and Ader said to him, By all means let me go.
23. So Ader returned to his country; this is the mischief which Ader did, and he was a bitter enemy of Israel, and he reigned in the land of Edom.
26. And Jeroboam the son of Nabat, the Ephrathite of Sarira, the son of a widow, was servant of Solomon.
27. And this was the occasion of his lifting up his hands against king Solomon: now king Solomon built the citadel, he completed the fortification of the city of David his father.
28. And the man Jeroboam was very strong; and Solomon saw the young man that he was active, and he set him over the levies of the house of Joseph.
29. And it came to pass at that time, that Jeroboam went forth from Jerusalem, and Achia the Selonite the prophet found him in the way, and caused him to turn aside out of the way: and Achia was clad with a new garment, and they two were alone in the field.
30. And Achia laid hold of his new garment that was upon him, and tore it into twelve pieces:
31. and he said to Jeroboam, Take to yourself ten pieces, for thus says the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give you ten tribes.
32. Yet he shall have two tribes, for my servant David's sake, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.
33. Because he forsook me, and sacrificed to Astarte the abomination of the Sidonians, and to Chamos, and to the idols of Moab, and to their king the abomination of the children of Ammon, and he walked not in my ways, to do that which was right before me, as David his father did.
34. Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, (for I will certainly resist him all the days of his life,) for David my servant's sake, whom I have chosen.
35. But I will take the kingdom out of the hand of his son, and give you ten tribes.
36. But to his son I will give the two remaining tribes, that my servant David may have an establishment continually before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for myself to put my name there.
37. And I will take you, and you shall reign as your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel.
38. And it shall come to pass, if you will keep all the commandments that I shall give you, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right before me, to keep my ordinances and my commandments, as David my servant did, that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built to David.
40. And Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam: but he arose and fled into Egypt, to Susakim king of Egypt, and he was in Egypt until Solomon died.
41. And the rest of the history of Solomon, and all that he did, and all his wisdom, behold are not these things written in the book of the life of Solomon?
42. And the days during which Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel were forty years.
43. And Solomon slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David his father. And it came to pass when Jeroboam son of Nabat heard of it, even while he was yet in Egypt as he fled from the face of Solomon and lived in Egypt, he straightway comes into his own city, into the land of Sarira in the mount of Ephraim. And king Solomon slept with his fathers, and Roboam his son reigned in his stead.
** 12
.1-2 And king Roboam goes to Sikima; for all Israel were coming to Sikima to make him king.
3. And the people spoke to king Roboam, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy;
4. but do you now lighten somewhat of the hard service of your father, and of his heavy yoke which he put upon us, and we will serve you.
5. And he said to them, Depart for three days, and return to me. And they departed.
6. And the king referred the matter to the elders, who stood before Solomon his father while he was yet living, saying, How do you° advise that I should answer this people?
7. And they spoke to him, saying, If you will this day be a servant to this people, and will serve them, and will speak to them good words, then will they be your servants continually.
8. But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they gave him, and consulted with the young men who were brought up with him, who stood in his presence.
9. And he said to them, What counsel do you° give? And what shall I answer to this people who speak to me, saying, Lighten somewhat of the yoke which your father has put upon us?
10. And the young men who had been brought up with him, who stood before his face, spoke to him, saying, Thus shall you say to this people who have spoken to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, and do you now lighten it from off us: thus shall say to them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
11. And whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I also will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
12. And all Israel came to king Roboam on the third day, as the king spoke to them, saying, Return to me on the third day.
13. And the king answered the people harshly; and Roboam forsook the counsel of the old men which they counselled him.
14. And he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
15. And the king listened not to the people, because the change was from the Lord, that he might establish his word which he spoke by Achia the Selonite concerning Jeroboam the son of Nabat.
16. And all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them: and the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we any inheritance in the son of Jessae. Depart, O Israel, to your tents: now feed your own house, David. So Israel departed to his tents.
18. And the king sent Adoniram who was over the tribute; and they stoned him with stones, and he died: and king Roboam made haste to rise to flee to Jerusalem.
19. So Israel rebelled against the house of David until this day.
20. And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned out of Egypt, that they sent and called him to the assembly, and they made him king over Israel: and none followed the house of David except the tribe of Juda and Benjamin only.
21. And Roboam went into Jerusalem, and he assembled the congregation of Juda, and the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and twenty thousand young men, warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to recover the kingdom to Roboam the son of Solomon.
22. And the word of the Lord came to Samaia the man of God, saying,
23. Speak to Roboam the son of Solomon, king of Juda, and to all the house of Juda and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
24. Thus says the Lord, You° shall not go up, neither shall you° fight with your brethren the sons of Israel: return each man to his own home; for this thing is from me; and they listened to the word of the Lord, and they ceased from going up, according to the word of the Lord.
So king Solomon sleeps with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Roboam his son reigned in his stead in Jerusalem, being sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twelve years I Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Naanan, daughter of Ana son of Naas king of the children of Ammon. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked not in the way of David his father.
And there was a man of mount Ephraim, a servant to Solomon, and his name was Jeroboam: and the name of his mother was Sarira, a harlot: and Solomon made him head of the levies of the house of Joseph: and he built for Solomon Sarira in mount Ephraim; and he had three hundred chariots of horses: he built the citadel with the levies of the house of Ephraim; he fortified the city of David, and aspired to the kingdom, And Solomon sought to kill him; and he was afraid, and escaped to Susakim king of Egypt, and was with him until Solomon died.
And Jeroboam heard in Egypt that Solomon was dead: and he spoke in the ears of Susakim king of Egypt, saying, Let me go, and I will depart into my land: and Susakim said to him, Ask and request, and I will grant it you. And Susakim gave to Jeroboam Ano the oldest sister of Thekemina his wife: she was great among the daughters of the king, and she bore to Jerobaom Abia his son: and Jeroboam said to Susakim, Let me indeed go, and I will depart.
And Jeroboam departed out of Egypt, and came into the land of Saria that was in mount Ephraim, and there the whole in mount Ephraim, and there the whole tribe of Ephraim assembles, and Jeroboam built a fortress there.
And his young child was sick with a very severe sickness; and Jeroboam went to enquire concerning the child: and he said to Ano his wife, Arise, go, enquire of God concerning the child, whether he shall recover from his sickness. Now there was a man in Selom, an his name was Achia: and he was sixty years old, and the word of the Lord was with him. And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, and take in your hand loaves for the man of God, and cakes for his children, and grapes, and a pot of honey. And the woman arose, and took in her hand bread, and two cakes, and grapes, and a pot of honey, for Achia: and the man was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see. And she arose, up from Sarira and went; and it came to pass when she had come into the city to Achia the Selonite, that Achia said to his servant, Go out now to meet Ano the wife of Jeroboam, and you shall say to her, Come in, and stand not still: for thus says the Lord, I send grievous tidings to you. And Ano went in to the man of God; and Achia said to her, Why have you brought me bread and grapes, and cakes, and a pot of honey? Thus says the Lord, Behold, you shall depart from me, and it shall come to pass when you have entered into the city, even into Sarira, that your maidens shall come out to meet you, and shall say to you, The child is dead: for thus says the Lord, Behold, I will destroy every male of Jeroboam, and there shall be the dead of Jeroboam in the city, them the dogs shall eat, and him that eat, and he shall lament for the child, saying, Woe is me, Lord! For there has been found in him some good thing touching the Lord.
And the woman departed, when she heard this: and it came to pass as she entered into Sarira, that the child died; and there came forth a wailing to meet her. And Jeroboam went to Sikima in mount Ephraim, and assembled there the tribes of Israel; and Roboam the son of Solomon went up there. And the word of the Lord came to Samaias son of Enlami, saying, Take to yourself a new garment which has not gone into the water, and rend it into twelve pieces; and you shall five some to Jeroboam, and shall say to him, thus says the Lord, Take to yourself ten pieces to cover you: and Jeroboam took them: and Samaias said, Thus says the Lord concerning the ten tribes of Israel.
And the people said to Roboam the son of Solomon, Your father make his yoke heavy upon us, and made the meat of his table heavy; and now you shall lighten them upon us, and we will serve you. And Roboam said to the people, Wait three days, and I will return you an answer: and Roboam said, Bring in to me the elders, and I will take counsel with them what I shall answer to the people on the third day, So Roboam spoke in their ears, as the people sent to him to say: and the elders of the people said, Thus the people have spoken to you.
And Roboam rejected their counsel, and it pleased him not: and he sent and brought in those who had been brought up with him; and he said to them, Thus and thus has the people sent to me to say: and they that had been brought up with him said, Thus shall you speak to the people saying, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins; my father scourged you with whips, but I will rule you with scorpions.
And the saying pleased Roboam, and he answered the people as the young men, they that were brought up with him, counselled him: and all the people spoke as one man, every one to his neighbor, and they cried out all together, saying, We have no part in David, nor inheritance in the son of Jessae: to they tents, O Israel, every one; for this man is not for a prince or a ruler over us. And all the people was dispersed from Sikima, and they departed every one to his tent: and Roboam strengthened him self and departed, and mounted his chariot, and entered into Jerusalem: and there follow him the whole tribe of Juda, and the whole tribe of Benjamin. And it came to pass at the beginning of the year, that Roboam gathered all the men of Juda and Benjamin, and went up to fight with Jeroboam at Sikima. And the word of the Lord came to Sameas the man of God, saying, Speak to Roboam king of Juda, and to all the house of Juda and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying, Thus says the Lord, You° shall not go up, neither shall you° fight with your brethren the sons of Israel: return every man to his house, for this thing is from me. And they listened to the word of the Lord, and forbore to go up, according to the word of the Lord.
25. And Jeroboam built Sikima in mount Ephraim and lived in it, and went forth thence and built Phanuel.
26. And Jeroboam said in his heart, Behold, now the kingdom will return to the house of David.
27. If this people shall go up to offer sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem, then the heart of the people will return to the Lord, and to their master, to Roboam king of Juda, and they will kill me.
28. And the king took counsel, and went, and made two golden heifers, and said to the people, Let it suffice you to have gone hitherto to Jerusalem: behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
29. And he put one in Bethel, and he put the other in Dan.
30. And this thing became a sin; and the people went before one as far as Dan, and left the house of the Lord.
31. And he made houses on the high places, and made priests of any part of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
32. And Jeroboam appointed a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, according to the feast in the land of Juda;
33. and went up to the altar which he made in Baethel to sacrifice to the heifers which he made, and he placed in Baethel the priests of the high places which he had made. And he went up to the altar which he had made, on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, at the feast which he devised out of his own heart; and he made a feast to the children of Israel, and went up to the altar to sacrifice.
** 13
1. And behold, there came a man of God out of Juda by the word of the Lord to Baethel, and Jeroboam stood at the altar to sacrifice.
2. And he cried against the altar by the word of the Lord, and said, O altar, altar, thus says the Lord, Behold, a son is to be born to the house of David, Josias by name; and he shall offer upon you the priests of the high places, even of them that sacrifice upon you, and he shall burn men's bones upon you.
3. And in that day one shall give a sign, saying, This is the word which the Lord has spoken, saying, Behold, the altar is tore, and the fatness upon it shall be poured out.
4. And it came to pass when king Jeroboam heard the words of the man of God who called on the altar that was in Baethel, that the king stretched forth his hand from the altar, saying, Take hold of him. And, behold, his hand, which he stretched forth against him, withered, and he could not draw it back to himself.
5. And the altar was tore, and the fatness was poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God gave by the word of the Lord.
6. And king Jeroboam said to the man of God, Intreat the Lord your God, and let my hand be restored to me. And the man of God entreated the Lord, and he restored the king's hand to him, and it became as before.
7. And the king said to the man of God, Enter with me into the house, and dine, and I will give you a gift.
8. And the man of God said to the king, If you should give me the half of your house, I would not go in with you, neither will I eat bread, neither will I drink water in this place; for thus the Lord charged me by his word, saying,
9. Eat no bread, and drink no water, and return not by the way by which you came.
10. So he departed by another way, and returned not by the way by which he came to Baethel.
11. And there lived an old prophet in Baethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God did on that day in Baethel, and the words which he spoke to the king: and they turned the face of their father.
12. And their father spoke to them, saying, Which way went he? and his sons show him the way by which the man of God who came out of Juda went up.
13. And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass: and they saddled him the ass, and he mounted it,
14. and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said to him, Are you the man of God that came out of Juda? And he said to him, I am.
15. And he said to him, Come with me, and eat bread.
16. And he said, I shall not by any means be able to return with you, neither will I eat bread, neither will I drink water in this place.
17. For thus the Lord commanded me by word, saying, Eat not bread there, and drink not water, and return not there by the way by which you came.
18. And he said to him, I also am a prophet as you are; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back to you into your house, and let him eat bread and drink water: but he lied to him.
19. And he brought him back, and he ate bread and drank water in his house.
20. And it came to pass while they were sitting at the table, that the word of the Lord came to the prophet that brought him back;
21. and he spoke to the man of God that came out of Juda, saying, Thus says the Lord, Because you have resisted the word of the Lord, and have not kept the commandment which the Lord your God commanded you,
22. but have returned, and eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he spoke to you, saying, You shall not eat bread, and shall not drink water; therefore your body shall in nowise enter into the sepulchre of your fathers.
23. And it came to pass after he had eaten bread and drunk water, that he saddled the ass for him, and he turned and departed.
24. And a lion found him in the way, and killed him; and his body was cast out in the way, and the ass was standing by it, and the lion also was standing by the body.
25. And, behold, men were passing by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion was standing near the carcase: and they went in and spoke of it in the city where the old prophet lived.
26. And the prophet that turned him back out of the way heard, and said, This is the man of God who rebelled against the word of the Lord.
27. And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass, and they saddled it.
28. And he went and found the body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion were standing by the body: and the lion had not devoured the body of the man of God, and had not torn the ass.
29. And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it on his ass; and the prophet brought him back to his city, to bury him in his own tomb,
30. and they bewailed him, saying, Alas, brother.
31. And it came to pass after he had lamented him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, Whenever I die, bury me in this tomb wherein the man of God is buried; lay me by his bones, that my bones may be preserved with his bones.
32. For the word will surely come to pass which he spoke by the word of the Lord against the altar in Baethel, and against the high houses in Samaria.
33. And after this Jeroboam turned not from his sin, but he turned and made of part of the people priests of the high places: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became a priest for the high places.
34. And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to its destruction and its removal from the face of the earth.
** 14
.1-20

21. And Roboam son of Solomon ruled over Juda. Roboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in the city Jerusalem, which the Lord chose to put his name there out of all the tribes of Israel: and his mother's name was Naama the Ammonitess.
22. And Roboam did evil in the sight of the Lord; and he provoked him in all the things which their fathers did in their sins which they sinned.
23. And they built for themselves high places, and pillars, and planted groves on every high hill, and under every shady tree.
24. And there was a conspiracy in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord removed from before the children of Israel.
25. And it came to pass in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Susakim king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;
26. and took all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house, and the golden spears which David took out of the hand of the sons of Adrazaar king of Suba, and brought them into Jerusalem, even all that he took, and the golden shields which Solomon had made, and carried them away into Egypt.
27. And king Roboam made brazen shields instead of them; and the chiefs of the golden shields which Solomon had made, and the chiefs of the body guard, who kept the gate of the house of the king, were placed in charge over them.
28. And it came to pass when the king went into the house of the Lord, that the body guard took them up, and fixed them in the chamber of the body guard.
29. And the rest of the history of Roboam, and all that he did, behold, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
30. And there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam continually.
31. And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Abiu his son reigned in his stead.
** 15
1. And in the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam son of Nabat, Abiu son of Roboam reigns over Juda.
2. And he reigned three years over Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Maacha, daughter of Abessalom.
3. And he walked in the sins of his father which he wrought in his presence, and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of his father David.
4. Howbeit for David's sake the Lord gave him a remnant, that he might establish his children after him, and might establish Jerusalem.
.5-6 Forasmuch as David did that which was right in the sight of the Lord: he turned not from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life.
7. And the rest of the history of Abiu, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? And there was war between Abiu and Jeroboam.
8. And Abiu slept with his fathers in the twenty-fourth year of Jeroboam; and he is buried with his fathers in the city of David: And Asa his son reigns in his stead.
9. In the four and twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa begins to reign over Juda.
10. And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Ana, daughter of Abessalom.
11. And Asa did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, as David his father.
12. And he removed the sodomites out of the land, and abolished all the practices which his fathers had kept up.
13. And he removed Ana his mother from being queen, forasmuch as she gathered a meeting in her grove: and Asa cut down her retreats, and burnt them with fire in the brook of Kedron.
14. But he removed not the high places; nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with the Lord all his days.
15. And he brought in the pillars of his father, he even brought in his gold and silver pillars into the house of the Lord, and his vessels.
16. And there was war between Asa and Baasa king of Israel all their days.
17. And Baasa king of Israel went up against Juda, and built Rama, so that no one should go out or come in for Asa king of Juda.
18. And Asa took all the silver and the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house, and gave them into the hands of his servants; and king Asa sent them out to the son of Ader, the son of Taberema son of Azin king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying,
19. Make a covenant between me and you, and between my father and your father: behold! I have sent forth to you gold and silver for gifts: come, break your league with Baasa king of Israel, that he may go up from me.
20. And the son of Ader listened to king Asa, and sent the chiefs of his forces to the cities of Israel; and they struck Ain, Dan, and Abel of the house of Maacha, and all Chennereth, as far as the whole land of Nephthali.
21. And it came to pass when Baasa heard it, that he left off building Rama, and returned to Thersa.
22. And king Asa charged all Juda without exception: and they take up the stones of Rama and its timbers with which Baasa was building; and king Asa built with them upon the whole hill of Benjamin, and the watch-tower.
23. And the rest of the history of Asa, and all his mighty deeds which he wrought, and the cities which he built, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
24. And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Josaphat his son reigns in his stead.
25. And Nabat son of Jeroboam reigns over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Juda, and he reigned two years in Israel.
26. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sins wherein he caused Israel to sin.
27. And Baasa son of Achia, who was over the house of Belaan son of Achia, conspired against him, and struck him in Gabathon of the Philistines; for Nabat and all Israel were besieging Gabathon.
28. And Baasa killed him in the third year of Asa son of Asa king of Juda; and reigned in his stead.
29. And it came to pass when he reigned, that he struck the whole house of Jeroboam, and left none that breathed of Jeroboam, until he has destroyed him utterly, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke by his servant Achia the Selonite,
30. for the sins of Jeroboam, who led Israel into sin, even by his provocation wherewith he provoked the Lord God of Israel.
31. And the rest of the history of Nabat, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
32. And there was a war between Asa and Baasa king of Israel in all their days.
33. And in the third year of Asa king of Juda, Baasa the son of Achia begins to reign over Israel in Thersa, twenty and four years.
34. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and in his sins, as he caused Israel to sin.
** 16
1. And the word of the Lord came by the hand of Ju son of Anani to Baasa, saying,
2. Forasmuch as I lifted you up from the earth, and made you ruler over my people Israel; and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam, and have caused my people Israel to sin, to provoke me with their vanities;
3. Behold, I raise up enemies after Baasa, and after his house; and I will make your house as the house of Jeroboam son of Nabat.
4. Him that dies of Baasa in the city the dogs shall devour, and him that dies of his in the field the birds of the sky shall devour.
5. Now the rest of the history of Baasa, and all that he did, and his mighty acts, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
6. And Baasa slept with his fathers, and they bury him in Thersa; and Ela his son reigns in his stead.
7. And the Lord spoke by Ju the son of Anani against Baasa, and against his house, even all the evil which he wrought before the Lord to provoke him to anger by the works of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he struck him.
8. And Ela son of Baasa reigned over Israel two years in Thersa.
9. And Zambri, captain of half his cavalry, conspired against him, while he was in Thersa, drinking himself drunk in the house of Osa the steward at Thersa.
10. And Zambri went in and struck him and killed him, and reigned in his stead.
11. And it came to pass when he reigned, when he sat upon his throne,
12. that he struck all the house of Baasa, according to the word which the Lord spoke against the house of Baasa, and to Ju the prophet,
13. for all the sins of Baasa and Ela his son, as he led Israel astray to sin, to provoke the Lord God of Israel with their vanities.
14. And the rest of the deeds of Ela which he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
15. And Zambri reigned in Thersa seven days: and the army of Israel was encamped against Gabathon of the Philistines.
16. And the people heard in the army, saying, Zambri has conspired and struck the king: and the people of Israel made Ambri the captain of the host king in that day in the camp over Israel.
17. And Ambri went up, and all Israel with him, out of Gabathon; and they besieged Thersa.
18. And it came to pass when Zambri saw that his city was taken, that he goes into the inner chamber of the house of the king, and burnt the king's house over him, and died.
19. Because of his sins which he committed, doing that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, so as to walk in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and in his sins wherein he caused Israel to sin.
20. And the rest of the history of Zambri, and his conspiracies wherein he conspired, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
21. Then the people of Israel divides; half the people goes after Thamni the son of Gonath to make him king; and half the people goes after Ambri.
22. The people that followed Ambri overpowered the people that followed Thamni son of Gonath; and Thamni died and Joram his brother at that time, and Ambri reigned after Thamni.
23. In the thirty-first year of king Asa, Ambri begins to reign over Israel twelve years: he reigns six years in Thersa.
24. And Ambri bought the mount Semeron of Semer the lord of the mountain for two talents of silver; and he built upon the mountain, and they called the name of the mountain on which he built, after the name of Semer the lord of the mount, Semeron.
25. And Ambri did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and wrought wickedly beyond all that were before him.
26. And he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and in his sins wherewith he caused Israel to sin, to provoke the Lord God of Israel by their vanities.
27. And the rest of the acts of Ambri, and all that he did, and all his might, behold, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
28. And Ambri slept with his fathers, and is buried in Samaria; and Achaab his son reigns in his stead.
And in the eleventh year of Ambri Josaphat the son of Asa reigns, being thirty-five years old in the beginning of his reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Gazuba, daughter of Seli. And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and turned not from it, even from doing right in the eyes of the Lord: only they removed not any of the high places; they sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places. Now the engagements which Josaphat made with the king of Israel, and all his mighty deeds which he performed, and the enemies whom he fought against, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda? and the remains of the prostitution which they practiced in the days of Asa his father, he removed out of the land: and there was no king in Syria, but a deputy.
And king Josaphat made a ship at Tharsis to go to Sophir for gold: but it went not, for the ship was broken at Gasion Gaber. Then the king of Israel said to Josaphat, I will send forth your servants and my servants in the ship: but Josaphat would not. And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and is buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Joram his son reigned in his stead.
29. In the second year of Josaphat king of Juda, Achaab son of Ambri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
30. And Achaab did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and did more wickedly than all that were before him.
31. And it was not enough for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, but he took as wife, Jezabel the daughter of Jethebaal king of the Sidonians; and he went and served Baal, and worshipped him.
32. And he set up an altar to Baal, in the house of his abominations, which he built in Samaria.
33. And Achaab made a grove; and Achaab did yet more abominably, to provoke the Lord God of Israel, and to sin against his own life so that he should be destroyed: he did evil above all the kings of Israel that were before him.
34. And in his days Achiel the Baethelite built Jericho: he laid the foundation of it in Abiron his firstborn, and he set up the doors of it in Segub his younger son, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke by Joshua the son of Naue.
** 17
1. And Eliu the prophet, the Thesbite of Thesbae of Galaad, said to Achaab, As the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be these years dew nor rain, except by the word of my mouth.
2. And the word of the Lord came to Eliu, saying,
3. Depart hence eastward, and hide you by the brook of Chorrath, that is before Jordan.
4. And it shall be that you shall drink water of the brook, and I will charge the ravens to feed you there.
5. And Eliu did according to the word of the Lord, and he sat by the brook of Chorrath before Jordan.
6. And the ravens brought him loaves in the morning, and flesh in the evening and he drank water of the brook.
7. And it came to pass after some time, that the brook was dried up, because there had been no rain upon the earth.
8. And the word of the Lord came to Eliu, saying,
9. Arise, and go to Sarepta of the Sidonian land: behold, I have there commanded a widow-woman to maintain you.
10. And he arose and went to Sarepta, and came to the gate of the city: and, behold, a widow-woman was there gathering sticks; and Eliu cried after her, and said to her, Fetch me, I pray you, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
11. And she went to fetch it; and Eliu cried after her, and said, Bring me, I pray you, a morsel of the bread that is in your hand.
12. And the woman said, As the Lord your God lives, I have not a cake, but only a handful of meal in the pitcher, and a little oil in a cruse, and, behold, I am going to gather two sticks, and I shall go in and dress it for myself and my children, and we shall eat it and die.
13. And Eliu said to her, Be of good courage, go in and do according to your word: but make me thereof a little cake, and you shall bring it out to me first, and you shall make some for yourself and your children last.
14. For thus says the Lord, The pitcher of meal shall not fail, and the cruse of oil shall not diminish, until the day that the Lord gives rain upon the earth.
15. And the woman went and did so, and did eat, she, and he, and her children.
16. And the pitcher of meal failed not, and the cruse of oil was not diminished, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke by the hand of Eliu.
17. And it came to pass afterward, that the son of the woman the mistress of the house was sick; and his sickness was very severe, until there was no breath left in him.
18. And she said to Eliu, What have I to do with you, O man of God? have you come in to me to bring my sins to remembrance, and to kill my son?
19. And Eliu said to the woman, Give me your son. And he took him out of her bosom, and took him up to the chamber in which he himself lodged, and laid him on the bed.
20. And Eliu cried aloud, and said, Alas, O Lord, the witness of the widow with whom I sojourn, you have wrought evil for her in slaying her son.
21. And he breathed on the child thrice, and called on the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, let, I pray you, the soul of this child return to him.
22. And it was so, and the child cried out,
23. and he brought him down from the upper chamber into the house, and gave him to his mother; and Eliu said, See, your son lives.
24. And the woman said to Eliu, Behold, I know that you are a man of God, and the word of the Lord in your mouth is true.
** 18
1. And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the Lord came to Eliu in the third year, saying, Go, and appear before Achaab, and I will bring rain upon the face of the earth.
2. And Eliu went to appear before Achaab: and the famine was severe in Samaria.
3. And Achaab called Abdiu the steward. Now Abdiu feared the Lord greatly.
4. And it came to pass when Jezabel struck the prophets of the Lord, that Abdiu took a hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.
5. And Achaab said to Abdiu, Come, and let us go through the land, and to the fountains of water, and to the brooks, if by any means we may find grass, and may save the horses and mules, and so they will not perish from the tents.
6. And they made a division of the way between them to pass through it: Achaab went one way, and Abdiu went by another way alone.
7. And Abdiu was alone in the way; and Eliu came alone to meet him: and Abdiu hasted, and fell upon his face, and said, My lord Eliu, are you indeed he?
8. And Eliu said to him, I am: go say to your master, Behold, Eliu is here.
9. And Abdiu said, What sin have I committed, that you give your servant into the hand of Achaab to kill me?
10. As the Lord your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom, whither my lord has not sent to seek you; and if they said, He is not here, then has he set fire to the kingdom and its territories, because he has not found you.
11. And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Eliu is here.
12. And it shall come to pass when I shall have departed from you, that the Spirit of the Lord shall carry you to a land which I know not, and I shall go in to tell the matter to Achaab, and he will not find you and will kill me: yet your servant fears the Lord from his youth.
13. Has it not been told to you my lord, what I did when Jezabel killed the prophets of the Lord, that I hid a hundred men of the prophets of the Lord, by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?
14. And now you say to me, Go, say to your master, Behold, Eliu is here: and he shall kill me.
15. And Eliu said, As the Lord of Hosts before whom I stand lives, today I will appear before him.
16. And Abdiu went to meet Achaab, and told him: and Achaab hasted forth, and went to meet Eliu.
17. And it came to pass when Achaab saw Eliu, that Achaab said to Eliu, Are you he that perverts Israel?
18. And Eliu said, I do not pervert Israel; but it is you and your father's house, in that you° forsake the Lord your God, and you have gone after Baalim.
19. And now send, gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of shame four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, that eat at Jezabel's table.
20. And Achaab sent to all Israel, and gathered all the prophets to mount Carmel.
21. And Eliu drew near to them all: and Eliu said to them, How long will you° halt on both feet? if the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, follow him. And the people answered not a word.
22. And Eliu said to the people, I am left, the only one prophet of the Lord; and the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men, and the prophets of the groves four hundred.
23. Let them give us two oxen, and let them choose one for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire on the wood: and I will dress the other bullock, and put on no fire.
24. And do you° call loudly on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord my God, and it shall come to pass that the God who shall answer by fire, he is God. And all the people answered and said, The word which you have spoken is good.
25. And Eliu said to the prophets of shame, Choose to yourselves one calf, and dress it first, for you° are many; and call you° on the name of your god; but apply no fire.
26. And they took the calf and dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning till noon, and said, hear us, O Baal, hear us. And there was no voice, neither was there hearing, and they ran up and down on the altar which they had made.
27. And it was noon, and Eliu the Thesbite mocked them, and said, Call with a loud voice, for he is a god; for he is meditating, or else perhaps he is engaged in business, or perhaps he is asleep, and is to be awaked.
28. And they cried with a loud voice, and cut themselves according to their custom with knives and lancets until the blood gushed out upon them.
29. And they prophesied until the evening came; and it came to pass as it was the time of the offering of the sacrifice, that Eliu the Thesbite spoke to the prophets of the abominations, saying, Stand by for the present, and I will offer my sacrifice. And they stood aside and departed.
30. And Eliu said to the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him.
31. And Eliu took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of Israel, as the Lord spoke to him, saying, Israel shall be your name.
32. And he built up the stones in the name of the Lord, and repaired the altar that had been broken down; and he made a trench that would hold two measures of seed round about the altar.
33. And he piled the cleft wood on the altar which he had made, and divided the whole burnt offering, and laid it on the wood, and laid it in order on the altar, and said, Fetch me four pitchers of water, and pour it on the whole burnt offering, and on the wood. And they did so.
34. And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.
35. And the water ran round about the altar, and they filled the trench with water.
36. And Eliu cried aloud to the heaven, and said, Lord God of Abraam, and Isaac, and Israel, answer me, O Lord, answer me this day by fire, and let all this people know that you are the Lord, the God of Israel, and I am your servant, and for your sake I have wrought these works.
37. Hear me, O Lord, hear me, and let this people know that you are the Lord God, and you have turned back the heart of this people.
38. Then fire fell from the Lord out of heaven, and devoured the whole burnt offerings, and the wood and the water that was in the trench, and the fire licked up the stones and the earth.
39. And all the people fell upon their faces, and said, Truly the Lord is God; he is God.
40. And Eliu said to the people, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them; and Eliu brings them down to the brook Kisson, and he killed them there.
41. And Eliu said to Achaab, Go up, and eat and drink, for there is a sound of the coming of rain.
42. And Achaab went up to eat and to drink; and Eliu went up to Carmel, and stooped to the ground, and put his face between his knees,
43. and said to his servant, Go up, and look toward the sea. And the servant looked, and said, There is nothing: and Eliu said, Do you then go again seven times.
44. And the servant went again seven times: and it came to pass at the seventh time, that, behold, a little cloud like the sole of a man's foot brought water; and he said, Go up, and say to Achaab, make ready your chariot, and go down, lest the rain overtake you.
45. And it came to pass in the meanwhile, that the heaven grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Achaab wept, and went to Jezrael.
46. And the hand of the Lord was upon Eliu, and he girded up his loins, and ran before Achaab to Jezrael.
** 19
1. And Achaab told Jezabel his wife all that Eliu had done, and how he had slain the prophets with the sword.
2. And Jezabel sent to Eliu, and said, If you are Eliu and I am Jezabel, God do so to me, and more also, if I do not make your life by this time to-morrow as the life of one of them.
3. And Eliu feared, and rose, and departed for his life: and he comes to Bersabee to the land of Juda, and he left his servant there.
4. And he himself went a day's journey in the wilderness, and came and sat under a juniper tree; and asked concerning his life that he might die, and said, Let it be enough now, O Lord, take, I pray you, my life from me; for I am no better than my fathers.
5. And he lay down and slept there under a tree; and behold, some one touched him, and said to him, Arise and eat.
6. And Eliu looked, and, behold, at his head there was a cake of meal and a cruse of water; and he arose, and ate and drank, and returned and lay down.
7. And the angel of the Lord returned again, and touched him, and said to him, Arise, and eat, for the journey is far from you.
8. And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights to mount Choreb.
9. And he entered there into a cave, and rested there; and, behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and he said, What do you here, Eliu?
10. And Eliu said, I have been very jealous for the Lord Almighty, because the children of Israel have forsaken you: they have digged down your altars, and have slain your prophets with the sword; and I only am left alone, and they seek my life to take it.
11. And he said, You shall go forth to-morrow, and shall stand before the Lord in the mount; behold, the Lord will pass by. And, behold, a great and strong wind rending the mountains, and crushing the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake:
12. and after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire the voice of a gentle breeze.
13. And it came to pass when Eliu heard, that he wrapt his face in his mantle, and went forth and stood in the cave: and, behold, a voice came to him and said, What do you here, Eliu?
14. And Eliu said, I have been very jealous for the Lord Almighty; for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, and they have overthrown your altars, and have slain your prophets with the sword! and I am left entirely alone, and they seek my life to take it.
15. And the Lord said to him, Go, return, and you shall come into the way of the wilderness of Damascus: and you shall go and anoint Azael to be king over Syria.
16. And Ju the son of Namessi shall you anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisaie the son of Saphat shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.
17. And it shall come to pass, that him that escapes from the sword of Azael, Ju shall kill; and him that escapes from the sword of Ju, Elisaie shall kill.
18. And you shall leave in Israel seven thousand men, all the knees which had not bowed themselves to Baal, and every mouth which had not worshipped him.
19. And he departed thence, and finds Elisaie the son of Saphat, and he was plowing with oxen; there were twelve yoke before him, and he with the twelve, and he passed by to him, and cast his mantle upon him.
20. And Elisaie left the cattle, and ran after Eliu and said, I will kiss my father, and follow after you. And Eliu said, Return, for I have done a work for you.
21. And he returned from following him, and took a yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled them with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate: and he arose, and went after Eliu, and ministered to him.
** 20
1. And Nabuthai the Jezraelite had a vineyard, near the threshing floor of Achaab king of Samaria.
2. And Achaab spoke to Nabuthai, saying, Give me your vineyard, and I will have it for a garden of herbs, for it is near my house: and I will give you another vineyard better than it; or if it please you, I will give you money, the price of this your vineyard, and I will have it for a garden of herbs.
3. And Nabuthai said to Achaab, My God forbid me that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.
4. And the spirit of Achaab was troubled, and he lay down upon his bed, and covered his face, and ate no bread.
5. And Jezabel his wife went in to him, and spoke to him, saying, Why is your spirit troubled, and why do you eat no bread?
6. And he said to her, Because I spoke to Nabuthai the Jezraelite, saying, Give me your vineyard for money; or if you will, I will give you another vineyard for it: and he said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.
7. And Jezabel his wife said to him, Do you now thus act the king over Israel? arise, and eat bread, and be your own master, and I will give you the vineyard of Nabuthai the Jezraelite.
8. And she wrote a letter in the name of Achaab, and sealed it with his seal, and sent the letter to the elders, and to the freemen who lived with Nabuthai.
9. And it was written in the letters, saying, Keep a fast, and set Naboth in a chief place among the people.
10. And set two men, sons of transgressors, before him, and let them testify against him, saying, He blessed God and the king: and let them lead him forth, and stone him, and let them die.
11. And the men of his city, the elders, and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezabel sent to them, and as it had been written in the letters which she sent to them.
12. And they proclaimed a fast, and set Nebuthai in a chief place among the people.
13. And two men, sons of transgressors, came in, and sat opposite him, and bore witness against him, saying, You have blessed God and the king. And they led him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, and he died.
14. And they sent to Jezabel, saying, Nabuthai is stoned, and is dead.
15. And it came to pass, when Jezabel heard it, that she said to Achaab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Nabuthai the Jezraelite, who would not sell it to you: for Nebuthai is not alive, for he is dead.
16. And it came to pass, when Achaab heard that Nabuthai the Jezraelite was dead, that he tore his garments, and put on sackcloth. And it came to pass afterward, that Achaab arose and went down to the vineyard of Nabuthai the Jezraelite, to take possession of it.
17. And the Lord spoke to Eliu the Thesbite, saying,
18. Arise, and go down to meet Achaab king of Israel, who is in Samaria, for he is in the vineyard of Nabuthai, for he has gone down there to take possession of it.
19. And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus says the Lord, Forasmuch as you have slain and taken possession, therefore thus says the Lord, In every place where the swine and the dogs have licked the blood of Nabuthai, there shall the dogs lick your blood; and the harlots shall wash themselves in your blood.
20. And Achaab said to Eliu, Hast you found me, my enemy? and he said, I have found you: because you have wickedly sold yourself to work evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger;
21. behold, I bring evil upon you: and I will kindle a fire after you, and I will utterly destroy every male of Achaab, and him that is shut up and him that is left in Israel.
22. And I will make your house as the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and as the house of Baasa son of Achia, because of the provocations wherewith you have provoked me, and caused Israel to sin.
23. And the Lord spoke of Jezabel, saying, The dogs shall devour her within the fortification of Jezrael.
24. Him that is dead of Achaab in the city shall the dogs eat, and him that is dead of him in the field shall the birds of the sky eat.
25. But Achaab did wickedly, in that he sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his wife Jezabel led him astray.
26. And he did very abominably in following after the abominations, according to all that the Amorite did, whom the Lord utterly destroyed from before the children of Israel.
27. And because of the word, Achaab was pierced with sorrow before the Lord, and he both went weeping, and tore his garment, and girded sackcloth upon his body, and fasted; he put on sackcloth also in the day that he struck Nabuthai the Jezraelite, and went his way.
28. And the word of the Lord came by the hand of his servant Eliu concerning Achaab, and the Lord said,
29. Hast you seen how Achaab has been pricked to the heart before me? I will not bring on the evil in his days, but in his son's days will I bring on the evil.
** 21
1. And the son of Ader gathered all his forces, and went up and besieged Samaria, he and thirty-two kings with him, and all his horse and chariots: and they went up and besieged Samaria, and fought against it.
2. And he sent into the city to Achaab king of Israel, and said to him, Thus says the son of Ader,
3. Your silver and your gold are mine, and your wives and your children are mine.
4. And the king of Israel answered and said, As you have said, my lord, O king, I am yours, and all mine also.
5. And the messengers came again, and said, Thus says the son of Ader, I sent to you, saying, You shall give me your silver and your gold, and your wives and your children.
6. For at this time to-morrow I will send my servants to you, and they shall search your house, and the houses of your servants, and it shall be that all the desirable objects of their eyes on which they shall lay their hands, they shall even take them.
7. And the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Take notice now and consider, that this man seeks mischief: for he has sent to me concerning my wives, and concerning my sons, an concerning my daughters: I have not kept back from him my silver and my gold.
8. And the elders and all the people said to him, Listen not, and consent not.
9. And he said to the messengers of the son of Ader, Say to your master, All things that you have sent to your servant about at first I will do; but this thing I shall not be able to do. And the men departed, and carried back the answer to him.
10. And the son of Ader sent to him, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for foxes to all the people, even my infantry.
11. And the king of Israel answered and said, Let it be sufficient; let not the humpbacked boast as he that is upright.
12. And it came to pass when he returned him this answer, he and all the kings with him were drinking in tents: and he said to his servants, Form a trench. And they made a trench against the city.
13. And, behold, a prophet came to Achaab king of Israel, and said, Thus says the Lord, Hast you seen this great multitude? behold, I give it this day into your hands; and you shall know that I am the Lord.
14. And Achaab said, Whereby? And he said, Thus says the Lord, by the young men of the heads of the districts. And Achaab said, Who shall begin the battle? and he said, You.
15. And Achaab numbered the young men the heads of the districts, and they were two hundred and thirty: and afterwards he numbered the people, even every man fit for war, seven thousand.
16. And he went forth at noon, an the son of Ader was drinking and getting drunk in Socchoth, he and the kings, even thirty and two kings, his allies.
17. And the young men the heads of the districts went forth first; and they send and report to the king of Syria, saying, There are men come forth out of Samaria.
18. And he said to them, If they come forth peaceably, take them alive; and if they come forth to war, take them alive:
19. and let not the young men the heads of the districts go forth of the city. And the force that was behind them
20. struck each one the man next to him; and each one a second time struck the man next to him: and Syria fled, and Israel pursued them; and the son of Ader, even the king of Syria, escapes on the horse of a horseman.
21. And the king of Israel went forth, and took all the horses and the chariots, and struck the enemy with a great slaughter in Syria.
22. And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said, Strengthen yourself, and observe, and see what you shall do; for at the return of the year the son of Ader king of Syria comes up against you.
23. And the servants of the king of Syria, even they said, The God of Israel is a God of mountains, and not a God of valleys; therefore has he prevailed against us: but if we should fight against them in the plain, verily we shall prevail against them.
24. And do you this thing: Send away the kings, each one to his place, and set princes in their stead.
25. And we will give you another army according to the army that was destroyed, and cavalry according to the cavalry, and chariots according to the chariots, and we will fight against them in the plain, and we shall prevail against them. And he listened to their voice, and did so.
26. And it came to pass at the return of the year, that the son of Ader reviewed Syria, and went up to Apheca to war against Israel.
27. And the children of Israel were numbered, and came to meet them: and Israel encamped before them as two little flocks of goats, but Syria filled the land.
28. And there came the man of God, and said to the king of Israel, Thus says the Lord, Because Syria has said, The Lord God of Israel is a God of the hills, and he is not a God of the valleys, therefore will I give this great army into your hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord.
29. And they encamp one over against the other before them seven days. And it came to pass on the seventh day that the battle drew on, and Israel struck Syria, even a hundred thousand footmen in one day.
30. And the rest fled to Apheca, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty-seven thousand men that were left: and the son of Ader fled, and entered into an inner chamber, into a closet.
31. And he said to his servants, I know that the kings of Israel are merciful kings: let us now put sackcloth upon our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and let us go forth to the king of Israel, if by any means he will save our souls alive.
32. So they girded sackcloth upon their loins, and put ropes upon their heads, and said to the king of Israel, Your servant the son of Ader says, Let our souls live, I pray you. And he said, Does he yet live? He is my brother.
33. And the men divined, and offered drink-offerings; and they caught the word out of his mouth, and said, Your brother the son of Ader. And he said, Go you° in and fetch him. And the son of Ader went out to him, and they cause him to go up to him into the chariot.
34. And he said to him, The cities which my father took from your father I will restore to you; and you shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made streets in Samaria; and I will let you go with a covenant. And he made a covenant with him, and let him go.
35. And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor by the word of the Lord, Strike me, I pray, And the man would not strike him.
36. And he said to him, Because you have not listened to the voice of the Lord, therefore, behold, as you depart from me, a lion shall strike you: and he departed from him, and a lion found him, and struck him.
37. And he finds another man, and says, Strike me, I pray you. And the man struck him, and in striking wounded him.
38. And the prophet went and stood before the king of Israel by the way, and bound his eyes with a bandage.
39. And it came to pass as the king passed by, that he cried aloud to the king, and said, Your servant went out to war, and, behold, a man brought another man to me, and said to me, Keep his man; and if he should by any means escape, then your life shall go for his life, or you shall pay a talent of silver.
40. And it came to pass, that your servant looked round this way and that way, and the man was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, Behold, you have also destroyed snares set for me.
41. And he hasted, and took away the bandage from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him, that he was one of the prophets.
42. And he said to him, Thus says the Lord, Because you have suffered to escape out of your hand a man appointed to destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.
43. And the king of Israel departed confounded and discouraged, and came to Samaria.
** 22
1. And he rested three years, and there was no war between Syria and Israel.
2. And it came to pass in the third year, that Josaphat king of Juda went down to the king of Israel.
3. And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know you° that Remmath Galaad is ours, and we are slow to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?
4. And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, Will you go up with us to Remmath Galaad to battle?
5. And Josaphat said, As I am, so are you also; as my people, so is your people; as my horses, so are your horses. And Josaphat king of Juda said to the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray you, of the Lord today.
6. And the king of Israel gathered all the prophets together, about four hundred men; and the king said to them, Shall I go up to Remmath Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? and they said, Go up, and the Lord will surely give it into the hands of the king.
7. And Josaphat said to the king of Israel, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may enquire of the Lord by him?
8. And the king of Israel said to Josaphat, There is one man here for us to enquire of the Lord by; but I hate him, for he does not speak good of me, but only evil; Michaias son of Jemblaa. And Josaphat king of Juda said, Let not the king say so.
9. And the king of Israel called a eunuch and said, Bring hither quickly Michaias son of Jemblaa.
10. And the king of Israel and Josaphat king of Juda sat, each on his throne, armed in the gates of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
11. And Sedekias son of Chanaan made for himself iron horns, and said, Thus says the Lord, With these you shall push Syria, until it be consumed.
12. And all the prophets prophesied in like manner, saying, Go up to Remmath Galaad, and the thing shall prosper, and the Lord shall deliver it and the king of Syria into your hands.
13. And the messenger that went to call Michaias spoke to him, saying, Behold now, all the prophets speak with one mouth good concerning the king, let now your words be like the words of one of them, and speak good things.
14. And Michaias said, As the Lord lives, whatever the Lord shall say to me, that will I speak.
15. And he came to the king: and the king said to him, Michaias, shall I go up to Remmath Galaad to battle, or shall I forbear? and he said, Go up, and the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
16. And the king said to him, How often shall I adjure you, that you speak to me truth in the name of the Lord?
17. And he said, Not so. I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains as a flock without a shepherd: and the Lord said, Is not God lord of these? let each one return to his home in peace.
18. And the king of Israel said to Josaphat king of Juda, Did I not say to you that this man does not prophesy good to me, for he speaks nothing but evil?
19. And Michaias said, Not so, it is not I: hear the word of the Lord; it is not so. I saw the God of Israel sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven stood about him on his right hand and on his left.
20. And the Lord said, Who will deceive Achaab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall in Remmath Galaad? and one spoke one way, and another another way.
21. And there came forth a spirit and stood before the Lord, and said, I will deceive him.
22. And the Lord said to him, Whereby? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a false spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, You shall deceive him, yes, and shall prevail: go forth, and do so.
23. And now, behold, the Lord has put a false spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets, and the Lord has spoken evil against you.
24. And Sedekias the son of Chanaan came near and struck Michaias on the cheek, and said, What sort of a spirit of the Lord has spoken in you?
25. And Michaias said, Behold, you shall see in that day, when you shall go into an innermost chamber to hide yourself there.
26. And the king of Israel said, Take Michaias, and convey him away to Semer the keeper of the city;
27. and tell Joas the king's son to put this fellow in prison, and to feed him with bread of affliction and water of affliction until I return in peace.
28. And Michaias said, If you return at all in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me.
29. So the king of Israel went up, and Josaphat king of Juda with him to Remmath Galaad.
30. And the king of Israel said to Josaphat king of Juda, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle, and do you put on my raiment. So the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
31. And the king of Syria had charged the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight not against small or great, but against the king of Israel only.
32. And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Josaphat king of Juda, that they said, this seems to be the king of Israel. And they compassed him about to fight against him; and Josaphat cried out.
33. And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that this was not the king of Israel, that they returned from him.
34. And one drew a bow with a good aim, and struck the king of Israel between the lungs and the breast-plate: and he said to his charioteer, Turn your hands, and carry me away out of the battle, for I am wounded.
35. And the war was turned in that day, and the king was standing on the chariot, against Syria from morning till evening; and he shed the blood out of his wound, into the bottom of the chariot, and died at even, and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.
36. And the herald of the army stood at sunset, saying, Let every man go to his own city and his own land,
37. for the king is dead. And they came to Samaria, and buried the king in Samaria.
38. And they washed the chariot at the fountain of Samaria; and the swine and the dogs licked up the blood, and the harlots washed themselves in the blood, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke.
39. And the rest of the acts of Achaab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities which he built, behold, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
40. And Achaab slept with his fathers, and Ochozias his son reigned in his stead.
41. And Josaphat the son of Asa reigned over Juda: in the fourth year of Achaab king of Israel began Josaphat to reign.
42. Thirty and five years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Azuba daughter of Salai.
43. And he walked in all the way of Asa his father: he turned not from it, even from doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord.
44. Only he took not away any of the high places: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places.
45. And Josaphat was at peace with the king of Israel.
46. And the rest of the acts of Josaphat, and his mighty deeds, whatever he did, behold, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
51. And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried by his fathers in the city of David his father, and Joram his son reigned in his stead.
52. And Ochozias son of Achaab reigned over Israel in Samaria: in the seventeenth year of Josaphat king of Juda, Ochozias son of Achaab reigned over Israel in Samaria two years.
53. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of Achaab his father, and in the way of Jezabel his mother, and in the sins of the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who caused Israel to sin.
54. And he served Baalim, and worshipped them, and provoked the Lord God of Israel, according to all that had been done before him.
* IV Kingdoms
** 1
1. And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Achaab.
2. And Ochozias fell through the lattice that was in his upper chamber in Samaria and was sick; and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go and enquire of Baal fly, the god of Accaron, whether I shall recover of this my sickness. And they went to enquire of him.
3. And an angel of the Lord called Eliu the Thesbite, saying, Arise, and go to meet the messengers of Ochozias king of Samaria, and you shall say to them, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you° go to enquire of Baal fly, the God of Accaron? but it shall not be so.
4. For thus says the Lord, The bed on which you are gone up, you shall not come down from it, for you shall surely die. And Eliu went, and said so to them.
5. And the messengers returned to him, and he said to them, Why have you° returned?
6. And they said to him, A man came up to meet us, and said to us, Go, return to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus says the Lord, Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you go to enquire of Baal fly, the God of Accaron? it shall not be so: the bed on which you are gone up, you shall not come down from it, for you shall surely die.
7. So they returned and reported to the king as Eliu said: and he said to them, What was the manner of the man who went up to meet you, and spoke to you these words?
8. And they said to him, He was a hairy man, and girded with a leather girdle about his loins. And he said, This is Eliu the Thesbite.
9. And he sent to him a captain of fifty and his fifty; and he went up to him: and, behold, Eliu sat on the top of a mountain. And the captain of fifty spoke to him, and said, O man of God, the king has called you, come down.
10. And Eliu answered and said to the captain of fifty, And if I am a man of God, fire shall come down out of heaven, and devour you and your fifty. And fire came down out of heaven, and devoured him and his fifty.
11. And the king sent a second time to him another captain of fifty, and his fifty. And the captain of fifty spoke to him, and said, O man of God, thus says the king, Come down quickly.
12. And Eliu answered and spoke to him, and said, If I am a man of God, fire shall come down out of heaven, and devour you and your fifty. And fire came down out of heaven, and devoured him and his fifty.
13. And the king sent yet again a captain and his fifty. And the third captain of fifty came, and knelt on his knees before Eliu, and entreated him, and spoke to him and said, O man of God, let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your eyes.
14. Behold, fire came down from heaven, and devoured the two first captains of fifty: and now, I pray, let my life be precious in your eyes.
15. And the angel of the Lord spoke to Eliu, and said, Go down with him, be not afraid of them. And Eliu rose up, and went down with him to the king.
16. And Eliu spoke to him, and said, Thus says the Lord, Why have you sent messengers to enquire of Baal fly, the god of Accaron? it shall not be so: the bed on which you are gone up, you shall not come down from it, for you shall surely die.
17. So he died according to the word of the Lord which Eliu has spoken.
18. And the rest of the acts of Ochozias which he did, behold, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? and Joram son of Achaab reigns over Israel in Samaria twelve years beginning in the eighteenth year of Josaphat king of Juda: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, only not as his brethren, nor as his mother: and he removed the pillars of Baal which his father made, and broke them in pieces: only he was joined to the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who led Israel to sin; he departed not from them. And the Lord was very angry with the house of Achaab.
** 2
1. And it came to pass, when the Lord was going to take Eliu with a whirlwind as it were into heaven, that Eliu and Elisaie went out of Galgala.
2. And Eliu said to Elisaie, Stay here, I pray you; for God has sent me to Baethel. And Elisaie said, As the Lord lives and your soul lives, I will not leave you; so they came to Baethel.
3. And the sons of the prophets who were in Baethel came to Elisaie, and said to him, Do you know, that the Lord this day is going to take your lord away from your head? And he said, Yes, I know it; be silent.
4. And Eliu said to Elisaie, Stay here, I pray you; for the Lord has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the Lord lives and your soul lives, I will not leave you. And they came to Jericho.
5. And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho drew near to Elisaie, and said to him, Do you know that the Lord is about to take away your master today from your head? And he said, Yes, I know it; hold your peace.
6. And Eliu said to him, Stay here, I pray you, for the Lord has sent me to Jordan. And Elisaie said, As the Lord lives and your soul lives, I will not leave you: and they both went on.
7. And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went also, and they stood opposite afar off: and both stood on the bank of Jordan.
8. And Eliu took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the water: and the water was divided on this side and on that side, and they both went over on dry ground.
9. And it came to pass while they were crossing over, that Eliu said to Elisaie, Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken up from you. And Elisaie said, Let there be, I pray you, in your spirit. a double portion of your spirit upon me.
10. And Eliu said, You have asked a hard thing: if you shall see me when I am taken up from you, then shall it be so to you; and if not, it shall not be so.
11. And it came to pass as they were going, they went on talking; and, behold, a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and it separated between them both; and Eliu was taken up in a whirlwind as it were into heaven.
12. And Elisaie saw, and cried, Father, father, the chariot of Israel, and the horseman thereof! And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his garments, and tore them into two pieces.
13. And Elisaie took up the mantle of Eliu, which fell from off him upon Elisaie; and Elisaie returned, and stood upon the brink of Jordan;
14. and he took the mantle of Eliu, which fell from off him, and struck the water, and said, Where is the Lord God of Eliu? and he struck the waters, and they were divided hither and there; and Elisaie went over.
15. And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho on the opposite side saw him, and said, The spirit of Eliu has rested upon Elisaie. And they came to meet him, and did obeisance to him to the ground.
16. And they said to him, Behold now, there are with your servants fifty men of strength: let them go now, and seek your lord: perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up, and cast him into Jordan, or on one of the mountains, or on one of the hills. And Elisaie said, You° shall not send.
17. And they pressed him until he was ashamed; and he said, Send. And they sent fifty men, and sought three days, and found him not.
18. And they returned to him, for he lived in Jericho: and Elisaie said, Did I not say to you, Go not?
19. And the men of the city said to Elisaie, Behold, the situation of the city is good, as our lord sees; but the waters are bad, and the ground barren.
20. And Elisaie said, Bring me a new pitcher, and put salt in it. And they took one, and brought it to him.
21. And Elisaie went out to the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and says, Thus says the Lord, I have healed these waters; there shall not be any longer death thence or barren land.
22. And the waters were healed until this day, according to the word of Elisaie which he spoke.
23. And he went up thence to Baethel: and as he was going up by the way there came up also little children from the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, bald-head, go up.
24. And he turned after them, and saw them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And, behold, there came out two bears out of the wood, and they tore forty and two children of them.
25. And he went thence to mount Carmel, and returned thence to Samaria.
** 3
1. And Joram the son of Achaab began to reign in Israel in the eighteenth year of Josaphat king of Juda, and he reigned twelve years.
2. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, only not as his father, nor as his mother: and he removed the pillars of Baal which his father had made.
3. Only he adhered to the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not from it.
4. And Mosa king of Moab was a sheep-master, and he rendered to the king of Israel in the beginning of the year, a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred thousand rams, with the wool.
5. And it came to pass, after the death of Achaab, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
6. And king Joram went forth in that day out of Samaria, and numbered Israel.
7. And he went and sent to Josaphat king of Juda, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: will you go with me against Moab to war? And he said, I will go up: you are as I, I am as you; as my people, so is your people, as my horses, so are your horses.
8. And he said, What way shall I go up? and he said, The way of the wilderness of Edom.
9. And the king of Israel went, and the king of Juda, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey; and there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that went with them.
10. And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the Lord should have called the three kings on their way, to give them into the hand of Moab.
11. And Josaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may enquire of the Lord by him? And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, There is here Elisaie son of Saphat, who poured water on the hands of Eliu.
12. And Josaphat said, He has the word of the Lord. And the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, and the king of Edom, went down to him.
13. And Elisaie said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? go to the prophets of your father, and the prophets of your mother. And the king of Israel said to him, Has the Lord called the three kings to deliver them into the hands of Moab?
14. And Elisaie said, As the Lord of hosts before whom I stand lives, unless I regarded the presence of Josaphat the king of Juda, I would not have looked on you, nor seen you.
15. And now fetch me a harper. And it came to pass, as the harper harped, that the hand of the Lord came upon him.
16. And he said, Thus says the Lord, Make this valley full of trenches.
17. For thus says the Lord, You° shall not see wind, neither shall you° see rain, yet this valley shall be filled with water, and you°, and your flocks, and your cattle shall drink.
18. And this is a light thing in the eyes of the Lord: I will also deliver Moab into your hand.
19. And you° shall strike every strong city, and you° shall cut down every good tree, and you° shall stop all wells of water, and spoil every good piece of land with stones.
20. And it came to pass in the morning, when the sacrifice was offered, that, behold! waters came from the way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.
21. And all Moab heard that the three kings were come up to fight against them; and they cried out on every side, even all that were girded with a girdle, and they said, Ho! and stood upon the border.
22. And they rose early in the morning, and the sun rose upon the waters, and Moab saw the waters on the opposite side red as blood.
23. And they said, This is the blood of the sword; and the kings have fought, and each man has struck his neighbor; now then to the spoils, Moab.
24. And they entered into the camp of Israel; and Israel arose and struck Moab, and they fled from before them; and they went on and struck Moab as they went.
25. And they razed the cities, and cast every man his stone on every good piece of land and filled it; and they stopped every well, and cut down every good tree, until they left only the stones of the wall cast down; and the slingers compassed the land, and struck it.
26. And the king of Moab saw that the battle prevailed against him; and he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to cut through to the king of Edom: and they could not.
27. And he took his oldest son whom he had designed to reign in his stead, and offered him up for a whole burnt offering on the walls. And there was a great indignation against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their land.
** 4
1. And one of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried to Elisaie, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant feared the Lord: and the creditor is come to take my two sons to be his servants.
2. And Elisaie said, What shall I do for you? tell me what you have in the house. And she said, Your servant has nothing in the house, except oil wherewith I anoint myself.
3. And he said to her, Go, borrow for yourself vessels without of all your neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.
4. And you shall go in and shut the door upon you and upon your sons, and you shall pour forth into these vessels, and remove that which is filled.
5. And she departed from him, and shut the door upon herself and upon her sons: they brought the vessels near to her, and she poured in until the vessels were filled.
6. And she said to her sons, Bring me yet a vessel. And they said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.
7. And she came and told the man of God: and Elisaie said, Go, and sell the oil, and you shall pay your debts, and you and your sons shall live of the remaining oil.
8. And a day came, when Elisaie passed over to Soman, and there was a great lady there, and she constrained him to eat bread: and it came to pass as often as he went into the city, that he turned aside to eat there.
9. And the woman said to her husband, See now, I know that this is a holy man of God who comes over continually to us.
10. Let us now make for him an upper chamber, a small place; and let us put there for him a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall come to pass that when he comes in to us, he shall turn in there.
11. And a day came, and he went in there, and turned aside into the upper chamber, and lay there.
12. And he said to Giezi his servant, Call me this Somanite. and he called her, and she stood before him.
13. And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, you have taken all this trouble for us; what should I do for you? Hast you any request to make to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she said, I dwell in the midst of my people.
14. And he said to Giezi, What must we do for her? and Giezi his servant said, Indeed she has no son, and her husband is old.
15. And he called her, and she stood by the door.
16. And Elisaie said to her, At this time next year, as the season is, you shall be alive, and embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, do not lie to your servant.
17. And the woman conceived, and bore a son at the very time, as the season was, being alive, as Elisaie said to her.
18. And the child grew: and it came to pass when he went out to his father to the reapers,
19. that he said to his father, My head, my head. and his father said to a servant, carry him to his mother.
20. And he carried him to his mother, and he lay upon her knees till noon, and died.
21. And she carried him up and laid him on the bed of the man of god; and she shut the door upon him, and went out.
22. And she called her husband, and said, Send now for me one of the young men, and one of the asses, and I will ride quickly to the man of God, and return.
23. And he said, Why are you going to him today? It is neither new moon, nor the Sabbath. And she said, It is well.
24. And she saddled the ass, and said to her servant, Be quick, proceed: spare not on my account to ride, unless I shall tell you. Go, and you shall proceed, and come to the man of God to mount Carmel.
25. And she rode and came to the man of God to the mountain: and it came to pass when Elisaie saw her coming, that he said to Giezi his servant, See now, that Somanite comes.
26. Now run to meet her, and you shall say, Is it well with you? is it well with your husband? is it well with the child? and she said, It is well.
27. And she came to Elisaie to the mountain, and laid hold of his feet; and Giezi drew near to thrust her away. And Elisaie said, Let her alone, for her soul is much grieved in her, and the Lord has hidden it from me, and has not told it me.
28. And she said, Did I ask a son of my lord? For did I not say, Do not deal deceitfully with me?
29. And Elisaie said to Giezi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go: if you meet any man, you shall not salute him, and if a man salute you you shall not answer him: and you shall lay my staff on the child's face.
30. And the mother of the child said, As the Lord lives and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And Elisaie arose, and went after her.
31. And Giezi went on before her, and laid his staff on the child's face: but there was neither voice nor any hearing. So he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.
32. And Elisaie went into the house, and, behold, the dead child was laid upon his bed.
33. And Elisaie went into the house, and shut the door upon themselves, the two, and prayed to the Lord.
34. And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and bowed himself upon him, and the flesh of the child grew warm.
35. And he returned, and walked up and down in the house: and he went up, and bowed himself on the child seven times; and the child opened his eyes.
36. And Elisaie cried out to Giezi, and said, Call this Somanite. So he called her, and she came in to him: and Elisaie said, Take your son.
37. And the woman went in, and fell at his feet, and did obeisance bowing to the ground; and she took her son, and went out.
38. And Elisaie returned to Galgala: and a famine was in the land; and the sons of the prophets sat before him: and Elisaie said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.
39. And he went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a vine in the field, and gathered of it wild gourds, his garment full; and he cast it into the caldron of pottage, for they knew them not.
40. And he poured it out for the men to eat: and it came to pass, when they were eating of the pottage, that behold! they cried out, and said, There is death in the pot, O man of God. And they could not eat.
41. And he said, Take meal, and cast it into the pot. And Elisaie said to his servant Giezi, Pour out for the people, and let them eat. And there was no longer there any hurtful thing in the pot.
42. And there came a man over from Baetharisa, and brought to the man of God twenty barley loaves and cakes of figs, of the first fruits. And he said, Give to the people, and let them eat.
43. And his servant said, Why should I set this before a hundred men? and he said, Give to the people, and let them eat; for thus says the Lord, They shall eat and leave.
44. And they ate and left, according to the word of the Lord.

1. Now Naiman, the captain of the host of Syria, was a great man before his master, and highly respected, because by him the Lord had given deliverance to Syria, and the man was mighty in strength, but a leper.
2. And the Syrians went forth in small bands, and took captive out of the land of Israel a little maid: and she waited on Naiman's wife.
3. And she said to her mistress, O that my lord were before the prophet of God in Samaria; then he would recover him from his leprosy.
4. And she went in and told her lord, and said, Thus and thus spoke the maid from the land of Israel.
5. And the king of Syria said to Naiman, Go to, go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he went, and took in his hand ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
6. And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now then, as soon as this letter shall reach you, behold, I have sent to you my servant Naiman, and you shall recover him from his leprosy.
7. And it came to pass, when the king of Israel read the letter, that he tore his garments, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to recover a man of his leprosy? consider, however, I pray you, and see that this man seeks an occasion against me.
8. And it came to pass, when Elisaie heard that the king of Israel had tore his garments, that he sent to the king of Israel, saying, Therefore have you tore your garments? Let Naiman, I pray you, come to me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel.
9. So Naiman came with horse and chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisaie.
10. And Elisaie sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash seven times in Jordan, and your flesh shall return to you, and you shall be cleansed.
11. And Naiman was angry, and departed, and said, Behold, I said, He will by all means come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of his God, and lay his hand upon the place, and recover the leper.
12. Are not the Abana and Pharphar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not go and wash in them, and be cleansed? and he turned and went away in a rage.
13. And his servants came near and said to him, Suppose the prophet had spoken a great thing to you, would you not perform it? yet he has but said to you, Wash, and be cleansed.
14. So Naiman went down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the word of Elisaie: and his flesh returned to him as the flesh of a little child, and he was cleansed.
15. And he and all his company returned to Elisaie, and he came and stood before him, and said, Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth, save only in Israel: and now receive a blessing of your servant.
16. And Elisaie said, As the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will not take one. And he pressed him to take one: but he would not.
17. And Naiman said, Well then, if not, let there be given to your servant, I pray you, the load of a yoke of mules; and you shall give me of the red earth: for henceforth your servant will not offer whole burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but only to the Lord by reason of this thing.
18. And let the Lord be propitious to your servant when my master goes into the house of Remman to worship there, and he shall lean on my hand, and I shall bow down in the house of Remman when he bows down in the house of Remman; even let the Lord, I pray, be merciful to your servant in this matter.
19. And Elisaie said to Naiman, Go in peace. And he departed from him a little way.
20. And Giezi the servant of Elisaie said, Behold, my Lord has spared this Syrian Naiman, so as not to take of his hand what he has brought: as the Lord lives, I will surely run after him, and take somewhat of him.
21. So Giezi followed after Naiman: and Naiman saw him running after him, and turned back from his chariot to meet him.
22. And Giezi said, All is well: my master has sent me, saying, Behold, now are there come to me two young men of the sons of the prophets from mount Ephraim; give them, I pray you, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.
23. And Naiman said, Take two talents of silver. And he took two talents of silver in two bags, and two changes of raiment, and put them upon two of his servants, and they bore them before him.
24. And he came to a secret place, and took them from their hands, and laid them up in the house, and dismissed the men.
25. And he went in himself and stood before his master; and Elisaie said to him,
26. Whence come you, Giezi? and Giezi said, Your servant has not been hither or there. And Elisaie said to him, Went not my heart with you, when the man returned from his chariot to meet you? and now you have received silver, and now you have received raiment, and olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants.
27. The leprosy also of Naiman shall cleave to you, and to your seed for ever. And he went out from his presence leprous, like snow.
** 6
1. And the sons of the prophets said to Elisaie, Behold now, the place wherein we dwell before you is too narrow for us.
2. Let us go, we pray you, to Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and make for ourselves a habitation there.
3. And he said, Go. And one of them said gently, Come with your servants. And he said, I will go.
4. And he went with them, and they came to Jordan, and began to cut down wood.
5. And behold, one was cutting down a beam, and the axe head fell into the water: and he cried out, Alas! master: and it was hidden.
6. And the man of God said, Where did it fall? and he showed him the place: and he broke off a stick, and threw it in there, and the iron came to the surface.
7. And he said, Take it up to yourself. And he stretched out his hand, and took it.
8. And the king of Syria was at war with Israel: and he consulted with his servants, saying, I will encamp in such a place.
9. And Elisaie sent to the king of Israel, saying, Take heed that you pass not by that place, for the Syrians are hidden there.
10. And the king of Israel sent to the place which Elisaie mentioned to him, and saved himself thence not once or twice.
11. And the mind of the king of Syria was very much disturbed concerning this thing; and he called his servants, and said to them, Will you° not tell me who betrays me to the king of Israel?
12. And one of his servants said, Nay, my Lord, O king, for Elisaie the prophet that is in Israel reports to the king of Israel all the words whatever you may say in your bedchamber.
13. And he said, Go, see where this man is, and I will send and take him. And they sent word to him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothaim.
14. And he sent there horses, and chariots, and a mighty host: and they came by night, and compassed about the city.
15. And the servant of Elisaie rose up early and went out; and, behold, a host compassed the city, and horses and chariots: and the servant said to him, O master, what shall we do?
16. And Elisaie said, Fear not, for they who are with us are more than they that are with them.
17. And Elisaie prayed, and said, Lord, open, I pray you, the eyes of the servant, and let him see. And the Lord opened his eyes, and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses, and there were chariots of fire round about Elisaie.
18. And they came down to him; and he prayed to the Lord, and said, Strike, I pray you, this people with blindness. And he struck them with blindness, according to the word of Elisaie.
19. And Elisaie said to them, This is not the city, and this is not the way: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you° seek. And he led them away to Samaria.
20. And it came to pass when they entered into Samaria, that Elisaie said, Open, I pray you, O Lord, their eyes, and let them see. And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
21. And the king of Israel said to Elisaie, when he saw them, Shall I not verily strike them, my father?
22. And he said, You shall not strike them, unless you would strike those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow: set bread and water before them, and let them eat and drink, and depart to their master.
23. And he set before them a great feast, and they ate and drank: and he dismissed them and they departed to their master. And the bands of Syria came no longer into the land of Israel.
24. And it came to pass after this, that the son of Ader king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up, and besieged Samaria.
25. And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was valued at fifty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung at five pieces of silver.
26. And the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, and a woman cried to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.
27. And he said to her, Unless the Lord help you, whence shall I help you? from the corn-floor, or from the wine-press?
28. And the king said to her, What is the matter with you? And the woman said to him, This woman said to me, Give your son, and we will eat him today, and we will eat my son to-morrow.
29. So we boiled my son, and ate him; and I said to her on the second day, Give your son, and let us eat him: and she has hidden her son.
30. And it came to pass, when the king of Israel heard the words of the woman, that he tore his garments; and he passed by on the wall, and the people saw sackcloth within upon his flesh.
31. And he said, God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisaie shall stand upon him this day.
32. And Elisaie was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and the king sent a man before him: before the messenger came to him, he also said to the elders, Do you° see that this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? See, as soon as the messenger shall have come, shut the door, and forcibly detain him at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
33. While he was yet speaking with them, behold, a messenger came to him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the Lord; why should I wait for the Lord any longer?
** 7
1. And Elisaie said, Hear you the word of the Lord; Thus says the Lord, As at this time, to-morrow a measure of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria.
2. And the officer on whose hand the king rested, answered Elisaie, and said, Behold, if the Lord shall make flood-gates in heaven, might this thing be? and Elisaie said, Behold, you shall see with your eyes, but shall not eat thereof.
3. And there were four leprous men by the gate of the city: and one said to his neighbor, Why sit we here until we die?
4. If we should say, Let us go into the city, then there is famine in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit here, then we shall die. Now then come, and let us fall upon the camp of the Syrians: if they should take us alive, then we shall live; and if they should put us to death, then we shall only die.
5. And they rose up while it was yet night, to go into the camp of Syria; and they came into a part of the camp of Syria, and behold, there was no man there.
6. For the Lord had made the army of Syria to hear a sound of chariots, and a sound of horses, even the sound of a great host: and each man said to his fellow, Now has the king of Israel hired against us the kings of the Chettites, and the kings of Egypt, to come against us.
7. And they arose and fled while it was yet dark, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses in the camp, as they were, and fled for their lives.
8. And these lepers entered a little way into the camp, and went into one tent, and ate and drank, and took thence silver, and gold, and raiment; and they went and returned thence, and entered into another tent, and took thence, and went and hid the spoil.
9. And one man said to his neighbor, We are not doing well thus: this day is a day of glad tidings, and we hold our peace, and are waiting till the morning light, and shall find mischief: now them come, and let us go into the city, and report to the house of the king.
10. So they went and cried toward the gate of the city, and reported to them, saying, We went into the camp of Syria, and, behold, there is not there a man, nor voice of man, only horses tied and asses, and their tents as they were.
11. And the porters cried aloud, and reported to the house of the king within.
12. And the king rose up by night, and said to his servants, I will now tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They knew that we are hungry; and they have gone forth from the camp and hidden themselves in the field, saying, They will come out of the city, and we shall catch them alive, and go into the city.
13. And one of his servants answered and said, Let them now take five of the horses that were left, which were left here; behold, they are the number left to all the multitude of Israel; and we will send there and see.
14. So they took two horsemen; and the king of Israel sent after the king of Syria, saying, Go, and see.
15. And they went after them even to Jordan: and, behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their panic. and the messengers returned, and brought word to the king.
16. And the people went out, and plundered the camp of Syria: and a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord, and two measures of barley for a shekel.
17. And the king appointed the officer on whose hand the king leaned to have charge over the gate: and the people trampled on him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when the messenger came down to him.
18. So it came to pass as Elisaie had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley shall be sold for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel; and it shall be as at this time to-morrow in the gate of Samaria.
19. And the officer answered Elisaie, and said, Behold, if the Lord makes flood-gates in heaven, shall this thing be? and Elisaie said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat thereof.
20. And it was so: for the people trampled on him in the gate, and he died.
** 8
1. And Elisaie spoke to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go you and your house, and sojourn wherever you may sojourn: for the Lord has called for a famine upon the land; indeed it is come upon the land for seven years.
2. And the woman arose, and did according to the word of Elisaie, both she and her house; and they sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
3. And it came to pass after the expiration of the seven years, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines to the city; and came to cry to the king for her house and for her lands.
4. And the king spoke to Giezi the servant of Elisaie the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray you, all the great things which Elisaie has done.
5. And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored to life the dead son, behold, the woman whose son Elisaie restored to life came crying to the king for her house and for her lands. And Giezi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisaie restored to life.
6. And the king asked the woman, and she told him: and the king appointed her a eunuch, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field from the day that she left the land until now.
7. And Elisaie came to Damascus; and the king of Syria the son of Ader was ill, and they brought him word, saying, The man of God is come here.
8. And the king said to Azael, Take in your hand a present, and go to meet the man of God, and enquire of the Lord by him, saying, Shall I recover of this my disease?
9. And Azael went to meet him, and he took a present in his hand, and all the good things of Damascus, forty camels' load, and came and stood before him, and said to Elisaie, Your son the son of Ader, the king of Syria, has sent me to you to enquire, saying, Shall I recover of this my disease?
10. And Elisaie said, Go, say, You shall certainly live; yet the Lord has showed me that you shall surely die.
11. And he stood before him, and fixed his countenance till he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.
12. And Azael said, Why does my lord weep? And he said, Because I know all the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: you will utterly destroy their strong holds with fire, and you will kill their choice men with the sword, and you will dash their infants against the ground, and their women with child you will rip up.
13. And Azael said, Who is your servant? a dead dog, that he should do this thing? And Elisaie said, The Lord has shown me you ruling over Syria.
14. And he departed from Elisaie, and went in to his lord; and he said to him, What said Elisaie to you? and he said, He said to me, You shall surely live.
15. And it came to pass on the next day that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and put it on his face, and he died: and Azael reigned in his stead.
16. In the fifth year of Joram son of Achaab king of Israel, and while Josaphat was king of Juda, Joram the son of Josaphat king of Juda began to reign.
17. Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
18. And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Achaab; for the daughter of Achaab was his wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.
19. But the Lord would not destroy Juda for David his servant's sake, as he said he would give a light to him and to his sons continually.
20. In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Juda, and they made a king over themselves.
21. And Joram went up to Sior, and all the chariots that were with him: and it came to pass after he had arisen, that he struck Edom who compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.
22. Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Juda till this day. Then Lobna revolted at that time.
23. And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
24. So Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David: and Ochozias his son reigned in his stead.
25. In the twelfth year of Joram son of Achaab king of Israel, Ochozias son of Joram began to reign.
26. Twenty and two years old was Ochozias when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and the name of his mother was Gotholia, daughter of Ambri king of Israel.
27. And he walked in the way of the house of Achaab, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as did the house of Achaab.
28. And he went with Joram the son of Achaab to war against Azael king of the Syrians in Remmoth Galaad; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
29. And king Joram returned to be healed in Jezrael of the wounds with which they wounded him in Remmoth, when he fought with Azael king of Syria. And Ochozias son of Joram went down to see Joram the son of Achaab in Jezrael, because he was sick.
** 9
1. And Elisaie the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, Gird up your loins, and take this cruse of oil in your hand, and go to Remmoth Galaad.
2. And you shall enter there, and shall see there Ju the son of Josaphat son of Namessi, and shall go in and make him rise up from among his brethren, and shall bring him into a secret chamber.
3. And you shall take the cruse of oil, and pour it on his head, and say you, Thus says the Lord, I have anointed you king over Israel: and you shall open the door, and flee, and not wait.
4. And the young man the prophet went to Remmoth Galaad.
5. And he went in, and, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have a message to you, O captain. And Ju said, To which of all us? And he said, To you, O captain.
6. And he arose, and went into the house: and he poured the oil upon his head, and said to him, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I have anointed you to be king over the people of the Lord, even over Israel.
7. And you shall utterly destroy the house of Achaab your master from before me, and shall avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezabel,
8. and at the hand of the whole house of Achaab: and you shall utterly cut off from the house of Achaab every male, and him that is shut up and left in Israel.
9. And I will make the house of Achaab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and as the house of Baasa the son of Achia.
10. And the dogs shall eat Jezabel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.
11. And Ju went forth to the servants of his lord, and they said to him, Is all well? Why came this mad fellow in to you? And he said to them, You° know the man, and his communication.
12. And they said, It is wrong: tell us now. And Ju said to them, Thus and thus spoke he to me, saying, —and he said, Thus says the Lord, I have anointed you to be king over Israel.
13. And when they heard it, they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with the trumpet, and said, Ju is king.
14. So Ju the son of Josaphat the son of Namessi conspired against Joram, and Joram was defending Remmoth Galaad, he and all Israel, because of Azael king of Syria.
15. And king Joram had returned to be healed in Jezrael of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, in his war with Azael king of Syria.
And Ju said, If your heart is with me, let there not go forth out of the city one fugitive to go and report to Jezrael.
16. And Ju rode and advanced, and came down to Jezrael; for Joram king of Israel was getting healed in Jezrael of the arrow-wounds wherewith the Syrians had wounded him in Rammath in the war with Azael king of Syria; for he was strong and a mighty man: and Ochozias king of Juda was come down to see Joram.
17. And there went up a watchman upon the tower of Jezrael, and saw the dust made by Ju as he approached; and he said, I see dust. And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Peace.
18. And there went a horseman to meet them, and said, Thus says the king, Peace. And Ju said, What have you to do with peace? turn behind me. And the watchman reported, saying, The messenger came up to them, and has not returned.
19. And he sent another horseman, and he came to him, and said, Thus says the king, Peace. And Ju said, What have you to do with peace? turn behind me.
20. And the watchman reported, saying, He came up to them, and has not returned: and the driver drives Ju the son of Namessi, for it is with furious haste.
21. And Joram said, Make ready. And one made ready the chariot: and Joram the king of Israel went forth, and Ochozias king of Juda, each in his chariot, and they went to meet Ju, and found him in the portion of Nabuthai the Jezraelite.
22. And it came to pass when Joram saw Ju, that he said, Is it peace, Ju? And Ju said, How can it be peace? as yet there are the whoredoms of your mother Jezabel, and her abundant witchcrafts.
23. And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ochozias, Treachery, Ochozias.
24. And Ju bent his bow with his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms, and his arrow went out at his heart, and he bowed upon his knees.
25. And Ju said to Badecar his chief officer, Cast him into the portion of ground of Nabuthai the Jezraelite, for I and you remember, riding as we were on chariots after Achaab his father, that the Lord took up this burden against him, saying,
26. Surely, I have seen yesterday the blood of Nabuthai, and the blood of his sons, says the Lord; and I will recompense him in this portion, says the Lord. Now then, I pray you, take him up and cast him into the portion, according to the word of the Lord.
27. And Ochozias king of Juda saw it, and fled by the way of Baethgan. And Ju pursued after him, and said, Slay him also. And one struck him in the chariot at the going up of Gai, which is Jeblaam: and he fled to Mageddo, and died there.
28. And his servants put him on a chariot, and brought him to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his sepulchre in the city of David.
29. And in the eleventh year of Joram king of Israel, Ochozias began to reign over Juda.
30. And Ju came to Jezrael; and Jezabel heard of it, and coloured her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked through the window.
31. And Ju entered into the city; and she said, Had Zambri, the murderer of his master, peace?
32. And he lifted up his face toward the window, and saw her, and said, Who are you? Come down with me. And two eunuchs looked down towards him.
33. And he said, Throw her down. And they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and they trampled on her.
34. And Ju went in and ate and drank, and said, Look now, after this cursed woman, and bury her, for she is a king's daughter.
35. And they went to bury her; but they found nothing of her but the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.
36. And they returned and told him. And he said, It is the word of the Lord, which he spoke by the hand of Eliu the Thesbite, saying, In the portion of Jezrael shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezabel.
37. And the carcass of Jezabel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezrael, so that they shall not say, This is Jezabel.
** 10
1. And Achaab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Ju wrote a letter, and sent it into Samaria to the rulers of Samaria, and to the elders, and to the guardians of the children of Achaab, saying.
2. Now then, as soon as this letter shall have reached you, whereas there are with you the sons of your master, and with you chariots and horses, and strong cities, and arms,
3. do you° accordingly look out the best and fit among your master's sons, and set him on the throne of his father, and fight for the house of your master.
4. And they feared greatly, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: and how shall we stand?
5. So they that were over the house, and they that were over the city, and the elders and the guardians, sent to Ju, saying, We also are your servants, and whatever you shall say to us we will do; we will not make any man king: we will do that which is right in your eyes.
6. And Ju wrote them a second letter, saying, If you° are for me, and listen to my voice, take the heads of the men your master's sons, and bring them to me at this time to-morrow in Jezrael. Now the sons of the king were seventy men; these great men of the city brought them up.
7. And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and killed them, even seventy men, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him at Jezrael.
8. And a messenger came and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay them in two heaps by the door of the gate until the morning.
9. And the morning came, and he went forth, and stood, and said to all the people, You° are righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and killed him: but who killed all these?
10. See now that there shall not fall to the ground anything of the word of the Lord which the Lord spoke against the house of Achaab: for the Lord has performed all that he spoke of by the hand of his servant Eliu.
11. And Ju struck all that were left of the house of Achaab in Jezrael, and all his great men, and his acquaintance, and his priests, so as not to leave him any remnant.
12. And he arose and went to Samaria, and he was in the house of sheep-shearing in the way.
13. And Ju found the brethren of Ochozias king of Juda, and said, Who are you°? And they said, We are the brethren of Ochozias, and we have come down to salute the sons of the king, and the sons of the queen.
14. And he said, Take them alive. And they killed them at the shearing-house, forty and two men: he left not a man of them.
15. And he went thence and found Jonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he saluted him, and Ju said to him, Is your heart right with my heart, as my heart is with your heart? And Jonadab said, It is. And Ju said, If it is then, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot.
16. And he said to him, Come with me, and see me zealous for the Lord. And he caused him to sit in his chariot.
17. And he entered into Samaria, and struck all that were left of Achaab in Samaria, until he had utterly destroyed him, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke to Eliu.
18. And Ju gathered all the people, and said to them, Achaab served Baal a little; Ju shall serve him much.
19. Now then do all you° the prophets of Baal call all his servants and his priests to me; let not a man be lacking: for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal; every one who shall be missing shall die. But Ju did it in subtilty, that he might destroy the servants of Baal.
20. And Ju said, Sanctify a solemn festival to Baal, and they made a proclamation.
21. And Ju sent throughout all Israel, saying, Now then let all Baal's servants, and all his priests, and all his prophets come, let none be lacking: for I am going to offer a great sacrifice; whoever shall be missing, shall not live. So all the servants of Baal came, and all his priests, and all his prophets: there was not one left who came not. And they entered into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other.
22. And he said to the man who was over the house of the wardrobe, Bring forth a robe for all the servants of Baal. And the keeper of the robes brought forth to them.
23. And Ju and Jonadab the son of Rechab entered into the house of Baal, and said to the servants of Baal, Search, and see whether there is among you any of the servants of the Lord, or only the servants of Baal, by themselves.
24. And he went in to offer sacrifices and whole burnt offerings; and Ju set for himself eighty men without, and said, Every man who shall escape of the men whom I bring into your hand, the life of him that spares him shall go for his life.
25. And it came to pass, when he had finished offering the whole burnt offering, that Ju said to the footmen and to the officers, Go you° in and kill them; let not a man of them escape. So they struck them with the edge of the sword, and the footmen and the officers cast the bodies forth, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
26. And they brought out the pillar of Baal, and burnt it.
27. And they tore down the pillars of Baal, and made his house a draught-house until this day.
28. So Ju abolished Baal out of Israel.
29. Nevertheless Ju departed not from following the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin: these were the golden heifers in Baethel and in Dan.
30. And the Lord said to Ju, Because of all your deeds wherein you have acted well in doing that which was right in my eyes, according to all things which you have done to the house of Achaab as they were in my heart, your sons to the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel.
31. But Ju took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart: he departed not from following the sins of Jeroboam, who made Israel to sin.
32. In those days the Lord began to cut Israel short; and Azael struck them in every coast of Israel;
33. from Jordan eastward all the land of Galaad belonging to the Gadites, of Gaddi and that of Ruben, and of Manasses, from Aroer, which is on the brink of the brook of Arnon, and Galaad and Basan.
34. And the rest of the acts of Ju, and all that he did, and all his might, and the wars wherein he engaged, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
35. And Ju slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joachaz his son reigned in his stead.
36. And the days which Ju reigned over Israel were twenty-eight years in Samaria.
** 11
1. And Gotholia the mother of Ochozias saw that her son was dead, and she destroyed all the seed royal.
2. And Josabee daughter of king Joram, sister of Ochozias, took Joas the son of her brother, and stole him from among the king's sons that were put to death, secreting him and his nurse in the bedchamber, and hid him from the face of Gotholia, and he was not slain.
3. And he remained with her hid in the house of the Lord six years: and Gotholia reigned over the land.
4. And in the seventh year Jodae sent and took the captains of hundreds of the Chorri and of the Rhasim, and brought them to him into the house of the Lord, and made a covenant of the Lord with them, and adjured them, and Jodae showed them the king's son.
5. And charged them, saying, This is the thing which you° shall do.
6. Let a third part of you go in on the sabbath-day, and keep you° the watch of the king's house in the porch; and another third in the gate of the high way, and a third at the gate behind the footmen; and keep you° the guard of the house.
7. And there shall be two parties among you, even every one that goes out on the Sabbath, and they shall keep the guard of the Lord's house before the king.
8. And do you° compass the king about every man with his weapon in his hand, and he that goes into the ranges shall die: and they shall be with the king in his going out and in his coming in.
9. And the captains of hundreds did all things that the wise Jodae commanded; and they took each his men, both those that went in on the sabbath-day, and those that went out on the sabbath-day, and went in to Jodae the priest.
10. And the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the swords and spears of king David that were in the house of the Lord.
11. And the footmen stood each with his weapon in his hand from the right corner of the house to the left corner of the house, by the altar and the house round about the king.
12. And he brought forth the king's son, and put upon him the crown and gave him the testimony; and he made him king, and anointed him: and they clapped their hands, and said, Long live the king.
13. And Gotholia heard the sound of the people running, and she went in to the people to the house of the Lord.
14. And she looked, and, behold, the king stood near a pillar according to the manner; and the singers and the trumpeters were before the king and all the people of the land even rejoicing and sounding with trumpets: and Gotholia tore her garments, and cried, A conspiracy, a conspiracy.
15. And Jodae the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were over the host, and said to them, Bring her forth without the ranges, and he that goes in after her shall certainly die by the sword. For the priest said, Let her not however be slain in the house of the Lord.
16. And they laid hands upon her, and went in by the way of the horses' entrance into the house of the Lord, and she was slain there.
17. And Jodae made a covenant between the Lord and the king and the people, that they should be the Lord's people; also between the king and the people.
18. And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and tore it down, and completely broke in pieces his altars and his images, and they killed Mathan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed overseers over the house of the Lord.
19. And he took the captains of the hundreds, and the Chorri, and the Rhasim, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king out of the house of the Lord; and they went in by the way of the gate of the footmen of the king's house, and seated him there on the throne of the kings.
20. And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was at rest: and they killed Gotholia with the sword in the house of the king.
21. Joas was seven years old when he began to reign.
** 12
1. Joas began to reign in the seventh year of Ju, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Sabia of Bersabee.
2. And Joas did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all the days that Jodae the priest instructed him.
3. Only there were not any of the high places removed, and the people still sacrificed there, and burned incense on the high places.
4. And Joas said to the priests, As for all the money of the holy things that is brought into the house of the Lord, the money of valuation, as each man brings the money of valuation, all the money which any man may feel disposed to bring into the house of the Lord,
5. let the priests take it to themselves, every man from the proceeds of his sale: and they shall repair the breaches of the house in all places wherever a breach shall be found.
6. And it came to pass in the twenty-third year of king Joas the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
7. And king Joas called Jodae the priest, and the other priests, and said to them, Why have you° not repaired the breaches of the house? now then receive no more money from your sales, for you° shall give it to repair the breaches of the house.
8. And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people, and not to repair the breaches of the house.
9. And Jodae the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it by the altar in the house of a man belonging to the house of the Lord, and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was found in the house of the Lord.
10. And it came to pass, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest went up, and they tied up and counted the money that was found in the house of the Lord.
11. And they gave the money that had been collected into the hands of them that wrought the works, the overseers of the house of the Lord; and they gave it out to the carpenters and to the builders that wrought in the house of the Lord.
12. And to the masons, and to the hewers of stone, to purchase timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord, for all that was spent on the house of the Lord to repair it.
13. Only there were not to be made for the house of the Lord silver plates, studs, bowls, or trumpets, any vessel of gold or vessel of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord:
14. for they were to give it to the workmen, and they repaired therewith the house of the Lord.
15. Also they took no account of the men into whose hands they gave the money to give to the workmen, for they acted faithfully.
16. Money for a sin-offering, and money for a trespass-offering, whatever happened to be brought into the house of the Lord, went to the priests.
17. Then went up Azael king of Syria, and fought against Geth, and took it: and Azael set his face to go against Jerusalem.
18. And Joas king of Juda took all the holy things which Josaphat, and Joram, Ochozias, his fathers, and kings of Juda had consecrated, and what he had himself dedicated, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the Lord's house and the king's house, and he sent them to Azael king of Syria; and he went up from Jerusalem.
19. And the rest of the acts of Joas, and all that he did, behold, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
20. And his servants rose up and made a conspiracy, and struck Joas in the house of Mallo that is in Sela.
21. And Jezirchar the son of Jemuath, and Jezabuth Somer's son, his servants, struck him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amessias his son reigned in his stead.
** 13
1. In the twenty-third year of Joas son of Ochozias king of Juda began Joachaz the son of Ju to reign in Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years.
2. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked after the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin; he departed not from them.
3. And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and delivered them into the hand of Azael king of Syria, and into the hand of the son of Ader son of Azael, all their days.
4. And Joachaz implored the Lord, and the Lord listened to him, for he saw the affliction of Israel, because the king of Syria afflicted them.
5. And the Lord gave deliverance to Israel, and they escaped from under the hand of Syria: and the children of Israel lived in their tents as heretofore.
6. Only they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who led Israel to sin: they walked in them—moreover the grove also remained in Samaria.
7. Whereas there was not left any army to Joachaz, except fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand infantry: for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and they made them as dust for trampling.
8. And the rest of the acts of Joachaz, and all that he did, and his mighty acts are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
9. And Joachaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria: and Joas his son reigned in his stead.
10. In the thirty-seventh year of Joas king of Juda, Joas the son of Joachaz began to reign over Israel in Samaria sixteen years.
11. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord; he departed not from all the sin of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin: he walked in it.
12. And the rest of the acts of Joas, and all that he did, and his mighty acts which he performed together with Amessias king of Juda, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
13. And Joas slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat upon his throne, and he was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
14. Now Elisaie was sick of his sickness, whereof he died: and Joas king of Israel went down to him, and wept over his face, and said, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horseman thereof!
15. And Elisaie said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took to himself a bow and arrows.
16. And he said to the king, Put your hand on the bow. And Joas put his hand upon it: and Elisaie put his hands upon the king's hands.
17. And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. And Elisaie said, Shoot. And he shot. And Elisaie said, The arrow of the Lord's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria; and you shall strike the Syrians in Aphec until you have consumed them.
18. And Elisaie said to him, Take bow and arrows. And he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Strike upon the ground. And the king struck three times, and stayed.
19. And the man of God was grieved at him, and said, If you had struck five or six times, then you should have struck Syria till you had consumed them; but now you shall strike Syria only thrice.
20. And Elisaie died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites came into the land, at the beginning of the year.
21. And it came to pass as they were burying a man, that behold, they saw a band of men, and they cast the man into the grave of Elisaie: and as soon as he touched the bones of Elisaie, he revived and stood up on his feet.
22. And Azael greatly afflicted Israel all the days of Joachaz.
23. And the Lord had mercy and compassion upon them, and had respect to them because of his covenant with Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob; and the Lord would not destroy them, and did not cast them out from his presence.
24. And Azael king of Syria died, and the son of Ader his son reigned in his stead.
25. And Joas the son of Joachaz returned, and took the cities out of the hand of the son of Ader the son of Azael, which he had taken out of the hand of Joachaz his father in the war: thrice did Joas strike him, and he recovered the cities of Israel.
** 14
1. In the second year of Joas the son of Joachaz king of Israel, did Amessias also the son of Joas the king of Juda begin to reign.
2. Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Joadim of Jerusalem.
3. And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not as David his father: he did according to all things that his father Joas did.
4. Only he removed not the high places: as yet the people sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places.
5. And it came to pass when the kingdom was established in his hand, that he killed his servants that had slain the king his father.
6. But he killed not the sons of those that had slain him; according as it is written in the book of the laws of Moses, as the Lord gave commandment, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, and the children shall not be put to death for the fathers; but every one shall die for his own sins.
7. He struck of Edom ten thousand in the valley of salt, and took the Rock in the war, and called its name Jethoel until this day.
8. Then Amessias sent messengers to Joas son of Joachaz son of Ju king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.
9. And Joas the king of Israel sent to Amessias king of Juda, saying, The thistle that was in Libanus sent to the cedar that was in Libanus, saying, Give my daughter to your son to wife: and the wild beasts of the field that were in Libanus passed by and trod down the thistle.
10. You have struck and wounded Edom, and your heart has lifted you up: stay at home and glorify yourself; for therefore are you quarrelsome to your hurt? So both you will fall and Juda with you.
11. Nevertheless Amessias listened not: so Joas king of Israel went up, and he and Amessias king of Juda looked one another in the face in Baethsamys of Juda.
12. And Juda was overthrown before Israel, and every man fled to his tent.
13. And Joas king of Israel took Amessias the son of Joas the son of Ochozias, in Baethsamys; and he came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, beginning at the gate of Ephraim as far as the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits.
14. And he took the gold, and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house, and the hostages, and returned to Samaria.
15. And the rest of the acts of Joas, even all that he did in his might, how he warred with Amessias king of Juda, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
16. And Joas slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.
17. And Amessias the son of Joas king of Juda lived after the death of Joas son of Joachaz king of Israel fifteen years.
18. And the rest of the acts of Amessias, and all that he did, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
19. And they formed a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachis: and they sent after him to Lachis, and killed him there.
20. And they brought him upon horses; and he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
21. And all the people of Juda took Azarias, and he was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amessias.
22. He built Aeloth, and restored it to Juda, after the king slept with his fathers.
23. In the fifteenth year of Amessias son of Joas king of Juda began Jeroboam son of Joas to reign over Israel in Samaria forty and one years.
24. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin.
25. He recovered the coast of Israel from the entering in of Aemath to the sea of Araba, according to the word of the Lord God of Israel, which he spoke by his servant Jonas the son of Amathi, the prophet of Gethchopher.
26. For the Lord saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter, and that they were few in number, straitened and in lack, and destitute, and Israel had no helper.
27. And the Lord said that he would not blot out the seed of Israel from under heaven; so he delivered them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joas.
28. And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did, and his mighty deeds, which he achieved in war, and how he recovered Damascus and Aemath to Juda in Israel, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
29. And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zacharias his son reigned in his stead.
** 15
1. In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel Azarias the son of Amessias king of Juda began to reign.
2. Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jechelia of Jerusalem.
3. And he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, according to all things that Amessias his father did.
4. Only he took not away any of the high places: as yet the people sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places.
5. And the Lord plagued the king, and he was leprous till the day of his death; and he reigned in a separate house. And Joatham the king's son was over the household, judging the people of the land.
6. And the rest of the acts of Azarias, and all that he did, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
7. And Azarias slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Joatham his son reigned in his stead.
8. In the thirty and eighth year of Azarias king of Juda Zacharias the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in Samaria six months.
9. And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, as his fathers had done: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin.
10. And Sellum the son of Jabis and others conspired against him, and they struck him in Keblaam, and killed him, and he reigned in his stead.
11. And the rest of the acts of Zacharias, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
12. This was the word of the Lord which he spoke to Ju, saying, Your sons of the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel: and it was so.
13. And Sellum the son of Jabis reigned: and in the thirty and ninth year of Azarias king of Juda began Sellum to reign a full month in Samaria.
14. And Manaem the son of Gaddi went up out of Tharsila, and came to Samaria, and struck Sellum the son of Jabis in Samaria, and killed him.
15. And the rest of the acts of Sellum, and his conspiracy wherein he was engaged, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
16. Then Manaem struck both Thersa and all that was in it, and its borders extending beyond Thersa, because they opened not to him: and he struck it, and ripped up the women with child.
17. In the thirty and ninth year of Azarias king of Juda began Manaem the son of Gaddi to reign over Israel in Samaria ten years.
18. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin.
19. In his days went up Phua king of the Assyrians against the land: and Manaem gave to Phua a thousand talents of silver to aid him with his power.
20. And Manaem raised the silver by a tax upon Israel, even on every mighty man in wealth, to give to the king of the Assyrians, fifty shekels levied on each man; and the king of the Assyrians departed, and remained not there in the land.
21. And the rest of the acts of Manaem, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
22. And Manaem slept with his fathers; and Phakesias his son reigned in his stead.
23. In the fifties year of Azarias king of Juda, began Phakesias the son of Manaem to reign over Israel in Samaria two years.
24. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin.
25. And Phakee the son of Romelias, his officer, conspired against him, and struck him in Samaria in the front of the king's house, with Argob and Aria, and with him there were fifty men of the four hundred: and he killed him, and reigned in his stead.
26. And the rest of the acts of Phakesias, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
27. In the fifty-second year of Azarias king of Juda began Phakee the son of Romelias to reign over Israel in Samaria twenty years.
28. And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who led Israel to sin.
29. In the days of Phakee king of Israel came Thalgath-phellasar king of the Assyrians, and took Ain, and Abel, and Thamaacha, and Anioch, and Kenez, and Asor, and Galaa, and Galilee, even all the land of Nephthali, and carried them away to the Assyrians.
30. And Osee son of Ela formed a conspiracy against Phakee the son of Romelias, and struck him, and killed him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Joatham the son of Azarias.
31. And the rest of the acts of Phakee, and all that he did, behold, these are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
32. In the second year of Phakee son of Romelias king of Israel began Joatham the son of Azarias king of Juda to reign.
33. Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jerusa daughter of Sadoc.
34. And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all things that his father Azarias did.
35. Nevertheless he took not away the high places: as yet the people sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places. He built the upper gate of the Lord's house.
36. And the rest of the acts of Joatham, and all that he did, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
37. In those days the Lord began to send forth against Juda Raasson king of Syria, and Phakee son of Romelias.
38. And Joatham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Achaz his son reigned in his stead.
** 16
1. In the seventeenth year of Phakee son of Romelias began Achaz the son of Joatham king of Juda to reign.
2. Twenty years old was Achaz when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not that which was right in the eyes of the Lord his God faithfully, as David his father had done.
3. And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, he made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel.
4. And he sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places, and upon the hills, and under every shady tree.
5. Then went up Raasson king of Syria and Phakee son of Romelias king of Israel against Jerusalem to war, and besieged Achaz, but could not prevail against him.
6. At that time Raasson king of Syria recovered Aelath to Syria, and drove out the Jews from Aelath, and the Idumeans came to Aelath, and lived there until this day.
7. And Achaz sent messengers to Thalgath-phellasar king of the Assyrians, saying, I am your servant and your son: come up, deliver me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who are rising up against me.
8. And Achaz took the silver and the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's house, and sent gifts to the king.
9. And the king of the Assyrians listened to him: and the king of the Assyrians went up to Damascus and took it, and removed the inhabitants, and killed king Raasson.
10. And king Achaz went to Damascus to meet Thalgath-phellasar king of the Assyrians at Damascus; and he saw an altar at Damascus. And king Achaz sent to Urias the priest the pattern of the altar, and its proportions, and all its workmanship.
11. And Urias the priest built the altar, according to all the directions which king Achaz sent from Damascus.
12. And the king saw the altar, and went up to it,
13. and offered his whole burnt offering, and his meat-offering, and his drink-offering, and poured out the blood of his peace-offerings on the brazen altar that was before the Lord.
14. And he brought forward the one before the house of the Lord from between the altar and the house of the Lord, and he set it openly by the side of the altar northwards.
15. And king Achaz charged Urias the priest, saying, Offer upon the great altar the whole burnt offering in the morning and the meat-offering in the evening, and the whole burnt offering of the king, and his meat-offering, and the whole burnt offering of all the people, and their meat-offering, and their drink-offering; and you shall pour all the blood of the whole burnt offering, and all the blood of any other sacrifice upon it: and the brazen altar shall be for me in the morning.
16. And Urias the priest did according to all that king Achaz commanded him.
17. And king Achaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them, and took down the sea from the brazen oxen that were under it, and set it upon a base of stone.
18. And he made a base for the throne in the house of the Lord, and he turned the king's entrance without in the house of the Lord because of the king of the Assyrians.
19. And the rest of the acts of Achaz, even all that he did, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
20. And Achaz slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Ezekias his son reigned in his stead.
** 17
1. In the twelfth year of Achaz king of Juda began Osee the son of Ela to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.
2. And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord, only not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
3. Against him came up Salamanassar king of the Assyrians; and Osee became his servant, and rendered him tribute.
4. And the king of the Assyrians found iniquity in Osee, in that he sent messengers to Segor king of Egypt, and brought not a tribute to the king of the Assyrians in that year: and the king of the Assyrians besieged him, and bound him in the prison-house.
5. And the king of the Assyrians went up against all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it for three years.
6. In the ninth year of Osee the king of the Assyrians took Samaria, and carried Israel away to the Assyrians, and settled them in Alae, and in Abor, near the rivers of Gozan, and in the mountains of the Medes.
7. For it came to pass that the children of Israel had transgressed against the Lord their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharao king of Egypt, and they feared other gods,
8. and walked in the statutes of the nations which the Lord cast out before the face of the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel as many as did such things,
9. and in those of the children of Israel as many as secretly practised customs, not as they should have done, against the Lord their God:
10. and they built for themselves high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city. And they made for themselves pillars and groves on every high hill, and under every shady tree.
11. And burned incense there on all high places, as the nations did whom the Lord removed from before them, and dealt with familiar spirits, and they carved images to provoke the Lord to anger.
12. And they served the idols, of which the Lord said to them, You° shall not do this thing against the Lord.
13. And the Lord testified against Israel and against Juda, even by the hand of all his prophets, and of every seer, saying, Turn you° from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my ordinances, and all the law which I commanded your fathers, and all that I sent to them by the hand of my servants the prophets.
14. But they listened not, and made their neck harder than the neck of their fathers.
15. And they kept not any of his testimonies which he charged them; and they walked after vanities, and became vain, and after the nations round about them, concerning which the Lord had charged them not to do accordingly.
16. They forsook the commandments of the Lord their God, and made themselves graven images, even two heifers, and they made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
17. And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divinations and auspices, and sold themselves to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him.
18. And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight; and there was only left the tribe of Juda quite alone.
19. Nay even Juda kept not the commandments of the Lord their God, but they walked according to the customs of Israel which they practised, and rejected the Lord.
20. And the Lord was angry with the whole seed of Israel, and troubled them, and gave them into the hand of them that spoiled them, until he cast them out of his presence.
21. Forasmuch as Israel revolted from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nabat king: and Jeroboam drew off Israel from following the Lord, and led them to sin a great sin.
22. And the children of Israel walked in all the sin of Jeroboam which he committed; they departed not from it,
23. until the Lord removed Israel from his presence, as the Lord spoke by all his servants the prophets; and Israel was removed from off their land to the Assyrians until this day.
24. And the king of Assyria brought from Babylon the men of Chutha, and men from Aia, and from Aemath, and Seppharvaim, and they were settled in the cities of Samaria in the place of the children of Israel: and they inherited Samaria, and were settled in its cities.
25. And it was so at the beginning of their establishment there that they feared not the Lord, and the Lord sent lions among them, and they killed some of them.
26. And they spoke to the king of the Assyrians, saying, The nations whom you have removed and substituted in the cities of Samaria for the Israelites, know not the manner of the God of the land: and he has sent the lions against them, and, behold, they are slaying them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.
27. And the king of the Assyrians commanded, saying, Bring some Israelites thence, and let them go and dwell there, and they shall teach them the manner of the God of the land.
28. And they brought one of the priests whom they had removed from Samaria, and he settled in Baethel, and taught them how they should fear the Lord.
29. But the nations made each their own gods, and put them in the house of the high places which the Samaritans had made, each nation in the cities in which they lived.
30. And the men of Babylon made Socchoth Benith, and the men of Chuth made Ergel, and the men of Haemath made Asimath.
31. And the Evites made Eblazer and Tharthac, and the inhabitant of Seppharvaim did evil when they burnt their sons in the fire to Adramelech and Anemelech, the gods of Seppharvaim.
32. And they feared the Lord, yet they established their abominations in the houses of the high places which they made in Samaria, each nation in the city in which they lived: and they feared the Lord, and they made for themselves priests of the high places, and sacrificed for themselves in the house of the high places.
33. And they feared the Lord, and served their gods according to the manner of the nations, whence their lords brought them.
34. Until this day they did according to their manner: they fear the Lord, and they do according to their customs, and according to their manner, and according to the law, and according to the commandment which the Lord commanded the sons of Jacob, whose name he made Israel.
35. And the Lord made a covenant with them, and charged them, saying, You° shall not fear other gods, neither shall you° worship them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:
36. but only to the Lord, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great strength and with a high arm: him shall you° fear, and him shall you° worship; to him shall you° sacrifice.
37. You° shall observe continually the ordinances, and the judgments, and the law, and the commandments which he wrote for you to do; and you° shall not fear other gods.
38. Neither shall you° forget the covenant which he made with you: and you° shall not fear other gods.
39. But you° shall fear the Lord your God, and he shall deliver you from all your enemies.
40. Neither shall you° comply with their practice, which they follow.
41. So these nations feared the Lord, and served their graven images: yes, their sons and their son's sons do until this day even as their fathers did.
** 18
1. And it came to pass in the third year of Osee son of Ela king of Israel that Ezekias son of Achaz king of Juda began to reign.
2. Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Abu, daughter of Zacharias.
3. And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father David did.
4. He removed the high places, and broke in pieces the pillars, and utterly destroyed the groves, and the brazen serpent which Moses made: because until those days the children of Israel burnt incense to it: and he called it Neesthan.
5. He trusted in the Lord God of Israel; and after him there was not any like him among the kings of Juda, nor among those that were before him.
6. And he clave to the Lord, he departed not from following him; and he kept his commandments, as many as he commanded Moses.
7. And the Lord was with him; and he was wise in all that he undertook: and he revolted from the king of the Assyrians, and served him not.
8. He struck the Philistines even to Gaza, and to the border of it, from the tower of the watchmen even to the strong city.
9. And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Ezekias (this is the seventh year of Osee son of Ela king of Israel,) that Salamanassar king of the Assyrians came up against Samaria, and besieged it.
10. And he took it at the end of three years, in the sixth year of Ezekias, (this is the ninth year of Osee king of Israel, when Samaria was taken.)
11. And the king of the Assyrians carried away the Samaritans to Assyria, and put them in Alae and in Abor, by the river Gozan, and in the mountains of the Medes;
12. because they listened not to the voice of the Lord their God, and transgressed his covenant, even in all things that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded, and listened not to them, nor did them.
13. And in the fourteenth year of king Ezekias came up Sennacherim king of the Assyrians against the strong cities of Juda, and took them.
14. And Ezekias king of Juda sent messengers to the king of the Assyrians to Lachis, saying, I have offended; depart from me: whatever you shall lay upon me, I will bear. And the king of Assyria laid upon Ezekias king of Juda a tribute of three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold.
15. And Ezekias gave all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house.
16. At that time Ezekias cut off the gold from the doors of the temple, and from the pillars which Ezekias king of Juda had overlaid with gold, and gave it to the king of the Assyrians.
17. And the king of the Assyrians sent Tharthan and Raphis and Rapsakes from Lachis to king Ezekias with a strong force against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem, and stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool, which is by the way of the fuller's field.
18. And they cried to Ezekias: and there came to him Heliakim the son of Chelcias the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and Joas the son of Saphat the recorder.
19. And Rapsakes said to them, Say now to Ezekias, Thus says the king, the great king of the Assyrians, What is this confidence wherein you trust?
20. You have said, (but they are mere words,) I have counsel and strength for war. Now then in whom do you trust, that you have revolted from me?
21. See now, are you trusting for yourself on this broken staff of reed, even upon Egypt? whoever shall stay himself upon it, it shall even go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharao king of Egypt to all that trust on him.
22. And whereas you have said to me, We trust on the Lord God: is not this he, whose high places and altars Ezekias has removed, and has said to Juda and Jerusalem, You° shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
23. And now, I pray you, make and agreement with my lord the king of the Assyrians, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you shall be able on your part to set riders upon them.
24. How then will you turn away the face of one petty governor, from among the least of my lord's servants? whereas you trust for yourself on Egypt for chariots and horsemen.
25. And now have we come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it? The Lord said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
26. And Heliakim the son of Chelkias, and Somnas, and Joas, said to Rapsakes, Speak now to your servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it; and speak not with us in the Jewish language: and why do you speak in the ears of the people that are on the wall?
27. And Rapsakes said to them, Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? has he not sent me to the men who sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own water together with you.
28. And Rapsakes stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language, and spoke, and said, Hear the words of the great king of the Assyrians:
29. thus says the king, Let not Ezekias encourage you with words: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand.
30. And let not Ezekias cause you to trust on the Lord, saying, The Lord will certainly deliver us; this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians: listen not to Ezekias:
31. for thus says the king of the Assyrians, Gain my favor, and come forth to me, and every man shall drink of the wine of his own vine, and every man shall eat of his own fig tree, and shall drink water out of his own cistern;
32. until I come and remove you to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, and bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil, and honey, and you° shall live and not die: and do not you° listen to Ezekias, for he deceives you, saying, The Lord shall deliver you.
33. Have the Gods of the nations at all delivered each their own land out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians?
34. Where is the god of Haemath, and of Arphad? where is the god of Seppharvaim, Ana, and Aba? for have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
35. Who is there among all the gods of the countries, who have delivered their countries out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
36. But the men were silent, and answered him not a word: for there was a commandment of the king, saying, You° shall not answer him.
37. And Heliakim the son of Chelcias, the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and Joas the son of Saphat the recorder came in to Ezekias, having tore their garments; and they reported to him the words of Rapsakes.
** 19
1. And it came to pass when king Ezekias heard it, that he tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth, an went into the house of the Lord.
2. And he sent Heliakim the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and the elders of the priests, clothed with sackcloth, to Esaias the prophet the son of Amos.
3. And they said to him, Thus says Ezekias, This day is a day of tribulation, and rebuke, and provocation: for the children are come to the travail-pangs, but the mother has no strength.
4. Peradventure the Lord your God will hear all the words of Rapsakes, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God and to revile him with the words which the Lord your God has heard: and you shall offer your prayer for the remnant that is found.
5. So the servants of king Ezekias came to Esaias.
6. And Esaias said to them, Thus shall you° say to your master, Thus says the Lord, Be not afraid of the words which you have heard, wherewith the servants of the king of the Assyrians have blasphemed.
7. Behold, I send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a report, and shall return to his own land; and I will overthrow him with the sword in his own land.
8. So Rapsakes returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Lobna: for he heard that he had departed from Lachis.
9. And he heard concerning Tharaca king of the Ethiopians, saying, Behold, he is come forth to fight with you: and he returned, and sent messengers to Ezekias, saying,
10. Let not your God on whom you trust encourage you, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hands of the king of the Assyrians.
11. Behold, you have heard all that the kings of the Assyrians have done in all the lands, to waste them utterly: and shall you be delivered?
12. Have the gods of the nations at all delivered them, whom my fathers destroyed; both Gozan, and Charran, and Raphis, and the sons of Edem who were in Thaesthen?
13. Where is the king of Haemath, and the king of Arphad? and where is the king of the city of Seppharvaim, of Ana, and Aba?
14. And Ezekias took the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and he went up to the house of the Lord, and Ezekias spread it before the Lord,
15. and said, O Lord God of Israel that dwell over the cherubs, you are the only god in all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.
16. Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear: open, Lord, your eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherim, which he has sent to reproach the living God.
17. For truly, Lord, the kings of Assyria have wasted the nations,
18. and have cast their gods into the fire: because they are no gods, but the works of men's hands, wood and stone; and they have destroyed them.
19. And now, O Lord our God, deliver us out of his hand, and all the kingdoms of the earth shall know that you alone are the Lord God.
20. And Esaias the son of Amos sent to Ezekias, saying, Thus says the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, I have heard your prayer to me concerning Sennacherim king of the Assyrians.
21. This is the word which the Lord has spoken against him; The virgin daughter of Sion has made light of you, and mocked you; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.
22. Whom have you reproached, and whom have you reviled? and against whom have you lifted up your voice, and raised your eyes on high? Is it against the Holy One of Israel?
23. By your messengers you have reproached the Lord, and have said, I will go up with the multitude of my chariots, to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Libanus, and I have cut down the height of his cedar, and his choice cypresses; and I have come into the midst of the forest and of Carmel.
24. I have refreshed myself, and have drunk strange waters, and I have dried up with the sole of my foot all the rivers of fortified places.
25. I have brought about the matter, I have brought it to a conclusion; and it is come to the destruction of the bands of warlike prisoners, even of strong cities.
26. And they that lived in them were weak in hand, they quaked and were confounded, they became as grass of the field, or as the green herb, the grass growing on houses, and that which is trodden down by him that stands upon it.
27. But I know your down-sitting, and your going forth, and your rage against me.
28. Because you was angry against me, and your fierceness is come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hooks in your nostrils, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.
29. And this shall be a sign to you; eat this year the things that grow of themselves, and in the second year the things which spring up: and in the third year let there be sowing, and reaping, and planting of vineyards, and eat you° the fruit of them.
30. And he shall increase him that has escaped of the house of Juda: and the remnant shall strike root beneath, and it shall produce fruit above.
31. For from Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and he that escapes from the mountain of Sion: the zeal of the Lord of host shall do this.
32. Is it not so?
Thus says the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians, He shall not enter into this city, and he shall not shoot an arrow there, neither shall a shield come against it, neither shall he heap a mound against it.
33. By the way by which he comes, by it shall he return, and he shall not enter into this city, says the Lord.
34. And I will defend this city as with a shield, for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
35. And it came to pass at night that the angel of the Lord went forth, an struck in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand: and they rose early in the morning, and, behold, these were all dead corpses.
36. And Sennacherim king of the Assyrians departed, and went and returned, and lived in Nineve.
37. And it came to pass, while he was worshipping in the house of Meserach his god, that Adramelech and Sarasar his sons struck him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararath; and Asordan his son reigned in his stead.
** 20
1. In those days was Ezekias sick even to death. And the prophet Esaias the son of Amos came in to him, and said to him, Thus says the Lord, Give charge to your household; for you shall die, and not live.
2. And Ezekias turned to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying,
3. Lord, remember, I pray you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your eyes. And Ezekias wept with a great weeping.
4. And Esaias was in the middle court, and the word of the Lord came to him, saying,
5. Turn back, and you shall say to Ezekias the ruler of my people, Thus says the Lord God of your father David, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I will heal you: on the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord.
6. And I will add to your days fifteen years; and I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant's David sake.
7. And he said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it upon the ulcer, and he shall be well.
8. And Ezekias said to Esaias, What is the sign that the Lord will heal me, and I shall go up to the house of the Lord on the third day?
9. And Esaias said, This is the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will perform the word which he has spoken, the shadow of the dial shall advance ten degrees: or if it should go back ten degrees this would also be the sign.
10. And Ezekias said, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return ten degrees backward on the dial.
11. And Esaias the prophet cried to the Lord: and the shadow returned back ten degrees on the dial.
12. At that time Marodach Baladan, son of Baladan king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Ezekias, because he had heard that Ezekias was sick.
13. And Ezekias rejoiced at them, and showed all the house of his spices, the silver and the gold, the spices, and the fine oil, and the armory, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing which Ezekias did not show them in his house, and in all his dominion.
14. And Esaias the prophet went in to king Ezekias, and said to him, What said these men? and whence came they to you? And Ezekias said, they came to me from a distant land, even from Babylon.
15. And he said, What saw they in your house? And he said, They saw all things that are in my house: there was nothing in my house which I showed not to them; yes, all that was in my treasures also.
16. And Esaias said to Ezekias, Hear the word of the Lord:
17. Behold, the days come, that all things that are in your house shall be taken, and all that your fathers have treasured up until this day, to Babylon; and there shall not fail a word, which the Lord has spoken.
18. And as for your sons which shall come forth of you, which you shall beget, the enemy shall take them, and they shall be eunuchs in the house of the king of Babylon.
19. And Ezekias said to Esaias, Good is the word of the Lord which he has spoken: only let there be peace in my days.
20. And the rest of the acts of Ezekias, and all his might, and all that he made, the fountain and the aqueduct, and how he brought water into the city, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
21. And Ezekias slept with his fathers: and Manasses his son reigned in his stead.
** 21
1. Manasses was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Apsiba.
2. And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord, according to the abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel.
3. And he built again the high places, which Ezekias his father had demolished; and set up an altar to Baal, and made groves as Achaab king of Israel made them; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
4. And he built an altar in the house of the Lord, whereas he had said, In Jerusalem I will place my name.
5. And he built an altar to all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord.
6. And he caused his sons to pass through the fire, and used divination and auspices, and made groves, and multiplied wizards, so as to do that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.
7. And he set up the graven image of the grove in the house of which the Lord said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I even place my name for ever.
8. And I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I gave to their fathers, even of those who shall keep all that I commanded, according to all the commandments which my servant Moses commanded them.
9. But they listened not; and Manasses led them astray to do evil in the sight of the Lord, beyond the nations whom the Lord utterly destroyed from before the children of Israel.
10. And the Lord spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,
11. Forasmuch as Manasses the king of Juda has wrought all these evil abominations, beyond all that the Amorite did, who lived before him, and has led Juda also into sin by their idols,
12. it shall not be so. Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I bring calamities upon Jerusalem and Juda, so that both the ears of every one that hears shall tingle.
13. And I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measure of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Achaab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a jar is wiped, and turned upside down in the wiping.
14. And I will reject the remnant of my inheritance, and will deliver them into the hands of their enemies; and they shall be for a plunder and for a spoil to all their enemies:
15. forasmuch as they have done wickedly in my sight, and have provoked me from the day that I brought out their fathers out of Egypt, even until this day.
16. Moreover Manasses shed very much innocent blood, until he filled Jerusalem with it from one end to the other, beside his sins with which he caused Juda to sin, in doing evil in the eyes of the Lord.
17. And the rest of the acts of Manasses, and all that he did, and his sin which he sinned, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
18. And Manasses slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his house, even in the garden of Oza: and Amos his son reigned in his stead.
19. Twenty and two years old was Amos when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Mesollam, daughter of Arus of Jeteba.
20. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as Manasses his father did.
21. And he walked in all the way in which his father walked, and served the idols which his father served, and worshipped them.
22. And he forsook the Lord God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the Lord.
23. And the servants of Amos conspired against him, and killed the king in his house.
24. And the people of the land killed all that had conspired against king Amos; and the people of the land made Josias king in his room.
25. And the rest of the acts of Amos, even all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
26. And they buried him in his tomb in the garden of Oza: and Josias his son reigned in his stead.
** 22
1. Josias was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jedia, daughter of Edeia of Basuroth.
2. And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way of David his father; he turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.
3. And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josias, in the eighth month, the king sent Sapphan the son of Ezelias the son of Mesollam, the scribe of the house of the Lord, saying,
4. Go up to Chelcias the high priest, and take account of the money that is brought into the house of the Lord, which they that keep the door have collected of the people.
5. And let them give it into the hand of the workmen that are appointed in the house of the Lord. And he gave it to the workmen in the house of the Lord, to repair the breaches of the house,
6. even to the carpenters, and builders, and masons, and also to purchase timber and hewn stones, to repair the breaches of the house.
7. Only they did not call them to account for the money that was given to them, because they dealt faithfully.
8. And Chelcias the high priest said to Saphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Chelcias gave the book to Sapphan, and he read it.
9. And he went into the house of the Lord to the king, and reported the matter to the king, and said, Your servants have collected the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and have given it into the hand of the workmen that are appointed in the house of the Lord.
10. And Sapphan the scribe spoke to the king, saying, Chelcias the priest has given me a book. And Sapphan read it before the king.
11. And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his garments.
12. And the king commanded Chelcias the priest, and Achikam the son of Sapphan, and Achobor the son of Michaias, and Sapphan the scribe, and Asaias the king's servant, saying,
13. Go, enquire of the Lord for me, and for all the people, and for all Juda, and concerning the words of this book that has been found: for the wrath of the Lord that has been kindled against us is great, because our fathers listened not to the words of this book, to do according to all the things written concerning us.
14. So Chelcias the priest went, and Achicam, and Achobor, and Sapphan, and Asaias, to Olda the prophetess, the mother of Sellem the son of Thecuan son of Aras, keeper of the robes; and she lived in Jerusalem in Masena; and they spoke to her.
15. And she said to them, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Say to the man that sent you to me,
16. Thus says the Lord, Behold, I bring evil upon this place, and upon them that dwell in it, even all the words of the book which the king of Juda has read:
17. because they have forsaken me, and burnt incense to other gods, that they might provoke me with the works of their hands: therefore my wrath shall burn forth against this place, and shall not be quenched.
18. And to the king of Juda that sent you to enquire of the Lord, —thus shall you° say to him, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, As for the words which you have heard;
19. because your heart was softened, and you was humbled before me, when you heard all that I spoke against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, that it should be utterly destroyed and accursed, and you did rend your garments, and weep before me; I also have heard, says the Lord.
20. It shall not be so therefore: behold, I will add you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your tomb in peace, and your eyes shall not see any among all the evils which I bring upon this place.
** 23
1. So they reported the word to the king: and the king sent and gathered all the elders of Juda and Jerusalem to himself.
2. And the king went up to the house of the Lord, and every man of Juda and all who lived in Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people small and great; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the Lord.
3. And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord, to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his ordinances with all the heart and with all the soul, to confirm the words of this covenant; even the things written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.
4. And the king commanded Chelcias the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and them that kept the door, to bring out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and all the host of heaven, and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kedron, and took the ashes of them to Baethel.
5. And he burned the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Juda had appointed, (and they burned incense in the high places and in the cities of Juda, and the places around about Jerusalem); and them that burned incense to Baal, and to the sun, and to the moon, and to Mazuroth, and to all the host of heaven.
6. And he carried out the grove from the house of the Lord to the brook Kedron, and burned it at the brook Kedron, and reduced it to powder, and cast its powder on the sepulchres of the sons of the people.
7. And he pulled down the house of the sodomites that were by the house of the Lord, where the women wove tents for the grove.
8. And he brought up all the priest from the cities of Juda, and defiled the high places where the priests burned incense, from Gaebal even to Bersabee; and he pulled down the house of the gates that was by the door of the gate of Joshua the ruler of the city, on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.
9. Only the priests of the high places went not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem, for they only ate leavened bread in the midst of their brethren.
10. And he defiled Taphes which is in the valley of the son of Ennom, constructed for a man to cause his son or his daughter to pass through fire to Moloch.
11. And he burned the horses which the king of Juda had given to the sun in the entrance of the house of the Lord, by the treasury of Nathan the king's eunuch, in the suburbs; and he burned the chariot of the sun with fire.
12. And the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Achaz, which the kings of Juda had made, and the altars which Manasses had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord, did the king pull down and forcibly remove from thence, and cast their dust into the brook of Kedron.
13. And the king defiled the house that was before Jerusalem, on the right hand of the mount of Mosthath, which Solomon king of Israel built to Astarte the abomination of the Sidonians, and to Chamos the abomination of Moab, and to Moloch the abomination of the children of Ammon.
14. And he broke in pieces the pillars, and utterly destroyed the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.
15. Also the high altar in Baethel, which Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who made Israel to sin, had made, even that high altar he tore down, and broke in pieces the stones of it, and reduced it to powder, and burnt the grove.
16. And Josias turned aside, and saw the tombs that were there in the city, and sent, and took the bones out of the tombs, and burnt them on the altar, and defiled it, according to the word of the Lord which the man of God spoke, when Jeroboam stood by the altar at the feast: and he turned and raised his eyes to the tomb of the man of God that spoke these words.
17. And he said, What is that mound which I see? And the men of the city said to him, It is the grave of the man of God that came out of Juda, and uttered these imprecations which he imprecated upon the altar of Baethel.
18. And he said, Let him alone; let no one disturb his bones. So his bones were spared, together with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.
19. Moreover Josias removed all the houses of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel made to provoke the Lord, and did to them all that he did in Baethel.
20. And he sacrificed all the priests of the high places that were there on the altars, and burnt the bones of men upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.
21. And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover to the Lord your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.
22. For a passover such as this had not been kept from the days of the judges who judged Israel, even all the days of the kings of Israel, and of the kings of Juda.
23. But in the eighteenth year of king Josias, was the passover kept to the Lord in Jerusalem.
24. Moreover Josias removed the sorcerers, and the wizards, and the theraphin, and the idols, and all the abominations that had been set up in the land of Juda and in Jerusalem, that he might keep the words of the law that were written in the book, which Chelcias the priest found in the house of the Lord.
25. There was no king like him before him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his strength, according to all the law of Moses; and after him there rose not one like him.
26. Nevertheless the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great anger, wherewith he was angry in his anger against Juda, because of the provocations, wherewith Manasses provoked him.
27. And the Lord said, I will also remove Juda from my presence, as I removed Israel, and will reject this city which I have chosen even Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.
28. And the rest of the acts of Josias, and all that he did, are not these things written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
29. And in his days went up Pharao Nechao king of Egypt against the king of the Assyrians to the river Euphrates: and Josias went out to meet him: and Nechao killed him in Mageddo when he saw him.
30. And his servants carried him dead from Mageddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre: and the people of the land took Joachaz the son of Josias, and anointed him, and made him king in the room of his father.
31. Twenty and three years old was Joachaz when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Amital, daughter of Jeremias of Lobna.
32. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his fathers did.
33. And Pharao Nechao removed him to Rablaam in the land of Emath, so that he should not reign in Jerusalem; and imposed a tribute on the land, a hundred talents of silver, and a hundred talents of gold.
34. And Pharao Nechao made Eliakim son of Josias king of Juda king over them in the place of his father Josias, and he changed his name to Joakim, and he took Joachaz and brought him to Egypt, and he died there.
35. And Joakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharao; but he assessed the land to give the money at the command of Pharao: they gave the silver and the gold each man according to his assessment together with the people of the land to give to Pharao Nechao.
36. Twenty-five years old was Joakim when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Jeldaph, daughter of Phadail of Ruma.
37. And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the lord, according to all that his fathers had done.
** 24
1. In his days went up Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and Joakim became his servant three years; and then he turned and revolted from him.
2. And the lord sent against him the bands of the Chaldeans, and the bands of Syria, and the bans of Moab, and the bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them into the land of Juda to prevail against it, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by his servants the prophets.
3. Moreover it was the purpose of the Lord concerning Juda, to remove them from his presence, because of the sins of Manasses, according to all that he did.
4. Moreover he shed innocent blood, and filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the Lord would not pardon it.
5. And the rest of the acts of Joakim, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Juda?
6. And Joakim slept with his fathers: and Joachim his son reigned in his stead.
7. And the king of Egypt came no more out of his land: for the king of Babylon took away all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the river of Egypt as far as the river Euphrates.
8. Eighteen years old was Joachim when he began to reign, an he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Nestha, daughter of Ellanastham, of Jerusalem.
9. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father did.
10. At that time went up Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
11. And Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants besieged it.
12. And Joachim king of Juda came forth to the king of Babylon, he and his servants, and his mother, and his princes, and his eunuchs; and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
13. And he brought forth thence all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house, and he cut up all the golden vessels which Solomon the king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord, according to the word of the Lord.
14. And he carried away the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all the captains, and the mighty men, taking captive ten thousand prisoners, and every artificer and smith: and only the poor of the land were left.
15. And he carried Joachim away to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his eunuchs: and he carried away the mighty men of the land into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
16. And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and one thousand artificers and smiths: all were mighty men fit for war; and the king of Babylon carried them captive to Babylon.
17. And the king of Babylon made Batthanias his son king in his stead, and called his name Sedekias.
18. Twenty and one years old was Sedekias when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Amital daughter of Jeremias.
19. And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Joachim did.
20. For it was according to the Lord's anger against Jerusalem and on Juda, until he cast them out of his presence, that Sedekias revolted against the king of Babylon.
** 25
1. And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came, and all his host, against Jerusalem; and he encamped against it, and built a mound against it.
2. And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Sedekias on the ninth day of the month.
3. And the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
4. And the city was broken up, and all the men of war went forth by night, by the way of the gate between the walls, this is the gate of the king's garden: and the Chaldeans were set against the city round about: and the king went by the way of the plain.
5. And the force of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army was dispersed from about him.
6. And they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon to Reblatha; and he gave judgment upon him.
7. And he killed the sons of Sedekias before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Sedekias, and bound him in fetters, and brought him to Babylon.
8. And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month (this is the nineteenth year of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon), came Nabuzardan, captain of the guard, who stood before the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem.
9. And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every house did the captain of the guard burn.
10. And the force of the Chaldeans pulled down the wall of Jerusalem round about.
11. And Nabuzardan the captain of the guard removed the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the men who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
12. But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vine-dressers and husbandmen.
13. And the Chaldeans broke to pieces the brazen pillars that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the Lord, and carried their brass to Babylon.
14. And the caldrons, and the shovels, and the bowls, and the censers, and all the brazen vessels with which they minister, he took.
15. And the captain of the guard took the fire-pans, and the gold and silver bowls.
16. Two pillars, and one sea, and the bases which Solomon made for the house of the Lord: there was no weight of the brass of all the vessels.
17. The height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it was of brass: and the height of the chapiter was three cubits: the border, and the pomegranates on the chapiter round about were all of brass: and so it was with the second pillar with its border.
18. And the captain of the guard took Saraias the high-priest, and Sophonias the second in order, and the three doorkeepers.
19. And they took out of the city one eunuch who was commander of the men of war, and five men that saw the face of the king, that were found in the city, and the secretary of the commander-in-chief, who took account of the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land that were found in the city.
20. And Nabuzardan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Reblatha.
21. And the king of Babylon struck them and killed them at Reblatha in the land of Aemath. So Juda was carried away from his land.
22. And as for the people that were left in the land of Juda, whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon left, even over them he set Godolias son of Achicam son of Saphan.
23. And all the captains of the host, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had thus appointed Godolias, and they came to Godolias to Massephath, both Ismael the son of Nathanias, and Jona son of Careth, and Saraias, son of Thanamath the Netophathite, and Jezonias son of a Machathite, they and their men.
24. And Godolias swore to them and their men, and said to them, Fear not the incursion of the Chaldeans; dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
25. And it came to pass in the seventh month that Ismael son of Nathanias son of Helisama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and he struck Godolias, that he died, him and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him in Massepha.
26. And all the people, great and small rose up, they and the captains of the forces, and went into Egypt; because they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
27. And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the carrying away of Joachim king of Juda, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, that Evialmarodec king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Joachim king of Juda, and brought him out of his prison-house.
28. And he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the thrones of the kings that were with him in Babylon;
29. And changed his prison garments: and he ate bread continually before him all the days of his life.
30. And his portion, a continual portion, was given him out of the house of the king, a daily rate for every day all the days of his life.
