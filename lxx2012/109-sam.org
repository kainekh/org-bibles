* I Kingdoms
** 1
1. There was a man of Armathaim Sipha, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Helkana, a son of Jeremeel the son of Elias the son of Thoke, in Nasib Ephraim.
2. And he had two wives; the name of the one was Anna, and the name of the second Phennana. And Phennana had children, but Anna had no child.
3. And the man went up from year to year from his city, from Armathaim, to worship and sacrifice to the Lord God of Sabaoth at Selom: and there were Heli and his two sons Ophni and Phinees, the priests of the Lord.
4. And the day came, and Helkana sacrificed, and gave portions to his wife Phennana and her children.
5. And to Anna he gave a prime portion, because she had no child, only Helkana loved Anna more than the other; but the Lord had closed her womb.
6. For the Lord gave her no child in her affliction, and according to the despondency of her affliction; and she was dispirited on this account, that the Lord shut up her womb so as not to give her a child.
7. So she did year by year, in going up to the house of the Lord; and she was dispirited, and wept, and did not eat.
8. And Helkana her husband said to her, Anna: and she said to him, Here am I, my lord: and he said to her, What ails you that you weep? and why do you not eat? and why does your heart strike you? am I not better to you than ten children?
9. And Anna rose up after they had eaten in Selom, and stood before the Lord: and Heli the priest was on a seat by the threshold of the temple of the Lord.
10. And she was very much grieved in spirit, and prayed to the Lord, and wept abundantly.
11. And she vowed a vow to the Lord, saying, O Lord God of Sabaoth, if you welt indeed look upon the humiliation of your handmaid, and remember me, and give to your handmaid a boy, then will I indeed dedicate him to you till the day of his death; and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink, and no razor shall come upon his head.
12. And it came to pass, while she was long praying before the Lord, that Heli the priest marked her mouth.
13. And she was speaking in her heart, and her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: and Heli accounted her a drunken woman.
14. And the servant of Heli said to her, How long will you be drunken? take away your wine from you, and go out from the presence of the Lord.
15. And Anna answered and said, Nay, my lord, I live in a hard day, and I have not drunk wine or strong drink, and I pour out my soul before the Lord.
16. Count not your handmaid for a pestilent woman, for by reason of the abundance of my importunity I have continued my prayer until now.
17. And Heli answered and said to her, Go in peace: the God of Israel give you all your petition, which you have asked of him.
18. And she said, Your handmaid has found favor in your eyes: and the woman went her way, and entered into her lodging, and ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance was no more sad.
19. And they rise early in the morning, and worship the Lord, and they go their way: and Helkana went into his house at Armathaim, and knew his wife Anna; and the Lord remembered her, and she conceived.
20. And it came to pass when the time was come, that she brought forth a son, and called his name Samuel, and said, Because I asked him of the Lord God of Sabaoth.
21. And the man Helkana and all his house went up to offer in Selom the yearly sacrifice, and his vows, and all the tithes of his land.
22. But Anna did not go up with him, for she said to her husband, I will not go up until the child goes up, when I have weaned him, and he shall be presented before the Lord, and he shall abide there continually.
23. And Helkana her husband said to her, Do that which is good in your eyes, abide still until you shall have weaned him; but may the Lord establish that which comes out of your mouth: and the woman tarried, and suckled her son until she had weaned him.
24. And she went up with him to Selom with a calf of three years old, and loaves, and an ephah of fine flour, and a bottle of wine: and she entered into the house of the Lord in Selom, and the child with them.
25. And they brought him before the Lord; and his father killed his offering which he offered from year to year to the Lord; and he brought near the child, and killed the calf; and Anna the mother of the child brought him to Heli.
26. And she said, I pray you, my lord, as your soul lives, I am the woman that stood in your presence with you while praying to the Lord.
27. For this child I prayed; and the Lord has given me my request that I asked of him.
28. And I lend him to the Lord all his days that he lives, a loan to the Lord: and she said,
** 2
1. My heart is established in the Lord, my horn is exalted in my God; my mouth is enlarged over my enemies, I have rejoiced in your salvation.
2. For there is none holy as the Lord, and there is none righteous as our God; there is none holy besides you.
3. Boast not, and utter not high things; let not high-sounding words come out of your mouth, for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and God prepares his own designs.
4. The bow of the mighty has waxed feeble, and the weak have girded themselves with strength.
5. They that were full of bread are brought low; and the hungry have forsaken the land; for the barren has born seven, and she that abounded in children has waxed feeble.
6. The Lord kills and makes alive; he brings down to the grave, and brings up.
7. The Lord makes poor, and makes rich; he brings low, and lifts up.
8. He lifts up the poor from the earth, and raises the needy from the dunghill; to seat him with the princes of the people, and causing them to inherit the throne of glory:
9. granting his petition to him that prays; and he blesses the years of the righteous, for by strength can’t man prevail.
10. The Lord will weaken his adversary; the Lord is holy. Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, nor let the mighty man boast in his strength, and let not the rich man boast in his wealth; but let him that boasts boast in this, to understand and know the Lord, and to execute judgment and justice in the midst of the earth. The Lord has gone up to the heavens, and has thundered: he will judge the extremities of the earth, and he gives strength to our kings, and will exalt the horn of his Christ. And she left him there before the Lord,
11. and departed to Armathaim: and the child ministered in the presence of the Lord before Heli the priest.
12. And the sons of Heli the priest were evil sons, not knowing the Lord.
13. And the priest's claim from every one of the people that sacrificed was this: the servant of the priest came when the flesh was in seething, and a flesh-hook of three teeth was in his hand.
14. And he struck it into the great caldron, or into the brazen vessel, or into the pot, and whatever came up with the flesh-hook, the priest took for himself: so they did to all Israel that came to sacrifice to the Lord in Selom.
15. And before the fat was burnt for a sweet savor, the servant of the priest would come, and say to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, and I will by no means take of you sodden flesh out of the caldron.
16. And if the man that sacrificed said, First let the fat be burned, as it is fit, and take for yourself of all things which your soul desires: then he would say, Nay, for you shall give it me now; and if not I will take it by force.
17. So the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord, for they set at nothing the offering of the Lord.
18. And Samuel ministered before the Lord, a child girded with a linen ephod.
19. And his mother made him a little doublet, and brought it to him from year to year, in her going up in company with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
20. And Heli blessed Helcana and his wife, saying The Lord recompense to you seed of this woman, in return for the loan which you have lent to the Lord: and the man returned to his place.
21. And the Lord visited Anna, and she bore yet three sons, and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the Lord.
22. And Heli was very old, and he heard what his sons did to the children of Israel.
23. And he said to them, Why do you° according to this thing, which I hear from the mouth of all the people of the Lord?
24. Nay my sons, for the report which I hear is not good; do not so, for the reports which I hear are not good, so that the people do not serve God.
25. If a man should at all sin against another, then shall they pray for him to the Lord; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him? But they listened not to the voice of their father, because the Lord would by all means destroy them.
26. And the child Samuel advanced, and was in favor with God and with men.
27. And a man of God came to Heli, and said, Thus says the Lord, I plainly revealed myself to the house of your father, when they were servants in Egypt to the house of Pharao.
28. And I chose the house of your father out of all the tribes of Israel to minister to me in the priest's office, to go up to my altar, and to burn incense, and to wear an ephod. And I gave to the house of your father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel for food.
29. And therefore have you looked upon my incense-offering and my meat-offering with a shameless eye, and have honored your sons above me, so that they should bless themselves with the first fruits of every sacrifice of Israel before me?
30. Therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel, I said, Your house and the house of your father shall pass before me for ever: but now the Lord says, That be far from me; for I will only honor them that honor me, and he that sets me at nothing shall be despised.
31. Behold, the days come when I will destroy your seed and the seed of your father's house.
32. And you shall not have an old man in my house for ever.
33. And if I do not destroy a man of your from my altar, it shall be that his eyes may fail and his soul may perish; and every one that remains in your house shall fall by the sword of men.
34. And this which shall come upon your two sons Ophni and Phinees shall be a sign to you; in one day they shall both die.
35. And I will raise up to myself a faithful priest, who shall do all that is in my heart and in my soul; and I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before my Christ for ever.
36. And it shall come to pass that he that survives in your house, shall come to do obeisance before him for a little piece of silver, saying, Put me into one of your priest's offices to eat bread.

1. And the child Samuel ministered to the Lord before Heli the priest: and the word of the Lord was precious in those days, there was no distinct vision.
2. And it came to pass at that time that Heli was sleeping in his place; and his eyes began to fail, and could not see.
3. And the lamp of God was burning before it was trimmed, and Samuel slept in the temple, where was the ark of God.
4. And the Lord called, Samuel, Samuel; and he said, Behold, here am I.
5. And he ran to Heli, and said, Here am I, for you did call me: and he said, I did not call you; return, go to sleep; and he returned and went to sleep.
6. And the Lord called again, Samuel, Samuel: and he went to Heli the second time, and said, Behold here am I, for you did call me: and he said, I called you not; return, go to sleep.
7. And it was before Samuel knew the Lord, and before the word of the Lord was revealed to him.
8. And the Lord called Samuel again for the third time: and he arose and went to Heli, and said, Behold, I am here, for you did call me: and Heli perceived that the Lord had called the child.
9. And he said, Return, child, go to sleep; and it shall come to pass if he shall call you, that you shall say, Speak for your servant hears: and Samuel went and lay down in his place.
10. And the Lord came, and stood, and called him as before: and Samuel said, Speak, for your servant hears.
11. And the Lord said to Samuel, Behold, I execute my words in Israel; whoever hears them, both his ears shall tingle.
12. In that day I will raise up against Heli all things that I have said against his house; I will begin, and I will make an end.
13. And I have told him that I will be avenged on his house perpetually for the iniquities of his sons, because his sons spoke evil against God, and he did not admonish them.
14. And it shall not go on so; I have sworn to the house of Eli, the iniquity of the house of Eli shall not be atoned for with incense or sacrifices for ever.
15. And Samuel slept till morning, and rose early in the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord; and Samuel feared to tell Heli the vision.
16. And Heli said to Samuel, Samuel, my son; and he said, Behold, here am I.
17. And he said, What was the word that was spoken to you? I pray you hide it not from me: may God do these things to you, and more also, if you hide from me any thing of all the words that were spoken to you in your ears.
18. And Samuel reported all the words, and hid them not from him. And Heli said, He is the Lord, he shall do that which is good in his sight.
19. And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and there did not fall one of his words to the ground.
20. And all Israel knew from Dan even to Bersabee, that Samuel was faithful as a prophet to the Lord.
21. And the Lord manifested himself again in Selom, for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel; and Samuel was accredited to all Israel as a prophet to the Lord from one end of the land to the other: and Heli was very old, and his sons kept advancing in wickedness, and their way was evil before the Lord.

1. And it came to pass in those days that the Philistines gathered themselves together against Israel to war; and Israel went out to meet them and encamped at Abenezer, and the Philistines encamped in Aphec.
2. And the Philistines prepare to fight with Israel, and the battle was turned against them; and the men of Israel fell before the Philistines, and there were struck in the battle in the field four thousand men.
3. And the people came to the camp, and the elders of Israel said, Why has the Lord caused us to fall this day before the Philistines? let us take the ark of our God out of Selom, and let it proceed from the midst of us, and it shall save us from the hand of our enemies.
4. And the people sent to Selom, and they take thence the ark of the Lord who dwells between the cherubs: and both the sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were with the ark.
5. And it came to pass when the ark of the Lord entered into the camp, that all Israel cried out with a loud voice, and the earth resounded.
6. And the Philistines heard the cry, and the Philistines said, What is this great cry in the camp of the Hebrews: and they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into the camp.
7. And the Philistines feared, and said, These are the Gods that are come to them into the camp.
8. Woe to us, O Lord, deliver us today for such a thing has not happened aforetime: woe to us, who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that struck Egypt with every plague, and in the wilderness.
9. Strengthen yourselves and behave yourselves like men, O you° Philistines, that you° may not serve the Hebrews as they have served us, but be you° men and fight with them.
10. And they fought with them; and the men of Israel fall, and they fled every man to his ten; and there was a very great slaughter; and there fell of Israel thirty thousand fighting men.
11. And the ark of God was taken, and both the sons of Heli, Ophni, and Phinees, died.
12. And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the battle, and he came to Selom on that day: and his clothes were tore, and earth was upon his head.
13. And he came, an behold, Heli was upon the seat by the gate looking along the way, for his heart was greatly alarmed for the ark of God: and the man entered into the city to bring tidings; and the city cried out.
14. And Heli heard the sound of the cry, and said, What is the voice of this cry? and the men hasted and went in, and reported to Heli.
15. Now Heli was ninety years old, and his eyes were fixed, and he saw not.
16. And Heli said to them that stood round about him, What is the voice of this sound? And the man hasted and advanced to Heli, and said to him, I am he that is come out of the camp, and I have fled from the battle today: and Heli said, What is the even, my son?
17. And they young man answered and said, The men of Israel fled from the face of the Philistines, and there was a great slaughter among the people, and both your sons are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
18. And it came to pass, when he mentioned the ark of God, that he fell from the seat backward near the gate, and his back was broken, and he died, for he was an old man and heavy: and he judged Israel twenty years.
19. And his daughter-in-law the wife of Phinees was with child, about to bring forth; and she heard the tidings, that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead; and she wept and was delivered, for her pains came upon her.
20. And in her time she was at the point of death; and the women that stood by her, said to her, Fear not, for you have born a son: but she answered not, and her heart did not regard it.
21. And she called the child Uaebarchaboth, because of the ark of God, and because of her father-in-law, and because of her husband.
22. And they said, The glory of Israel is departed, forasmuch as the ark of the Lord is taken.
** 5
1. And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Abenezer to Azotus.
2. And the Philistines took the ark of the Lord, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
3. And the people of Azotus rose early, and entered into the house of Dagon; and looked, and behold, Dagon had fallen on his face before the ark of the Lord: and they lifted up Dagon, and set him in his place. And the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Azotians, and he plagued them, and he struck them in their secret parts, Azotus and her coasts.
4. And it came to pass when they rose early in the morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off each before the threshold, and both the wrists of his hands had fallen on the floor of the porch; only the stump of Dagon was left.
5. Therefore the priests of Dagon, and every one that enters into the house of Dagon, do not tread upon the threshold of the house of Dagon in Azotus until this day, for they step over.
6. And the hand of the Lord was heavy upon Azotus, and he brought evil upon them, and it burst out upon them into the ships, and mice sprang up in the midst of their country, and there was a great and indiscriminate mortality in the city.
7. And the men of Azotus saw that it was so, and they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us, for his hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon our god.
8. And they send and gather the lords of the Philistines to them, and say, What shall we do to the ark of the God of Israel? and the Gittites say, Let the ark of God come over to us; and the ark of the God of Israel came to Geth.
9. And it came to pass after it went about to Geth, that the hand of the Lord comes upon the city, a very great confusion; and he struck the men of the city small and great, and struck them in their secret parts: and the Gittites made to themselves images of tumors.
10. And they send away the ark of God to Ascalon; and it came to pass when the ark of God went into Ascalon, that the men of Ascalon cried out, saying, Why have you° brought back the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people?
11. And they send and gather the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it lodge in its place; and let it not kill us and our people.
12. For there was a very great confusion in all the city, when the ark of the God of Israel entered there; and those, who lived and died not were struck with tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
** 6
1. And the ark was seven months in the country of the Philistines, and their land brought forth swarms of mice.
2. And the Philistines call their priests, and their prophets, and their enchanters, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the Lord? teach us wherewith we shall send it away to its place.
3. And they said, If you° send away the ark of the covenant of the Lord God of Israel, do not on any account send it away empty, but by all means render to it an offering for the plague; and then shall you° be healed, and an atonement shall be made for you: should not his hand be thus stayed from off you?
4. And they say, What is the offering for the plague which we shall return to it? and they said,
5. According to the number of the lords of the Philistines, five golden tumors, for the plague was on you, and on your rulers, and on the people; and golden mice, the likeness of the mice that destroy your land: and you° shall give glory to the Lord, that he may lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
6. And why do you° harden your hearts, as Egypt and Pharao hardened their hearts? was it not so when he mocked them, that they let the people go, and they departed?
7. And now take wood and make a new wagon, and take two cows, that have calved for the first time, without their calves; and do you° yoke the cows to the wagon, and lead away the calves from behind them home.
8. And you° shall take the ark and put it on the wagon; and you° shall restore to it the golden articles for the trespass-offering in a coffer by the side of it: and you° shall let it go, and sent it away, and you° shall depart.
9. And you° shall see, if it shall go the way of its coasts along by Baethsamys, he has brought upon us this great affliction; and if not, then shall we know that his hand has not touched us, but this is a chance which has happened to us.
10. And the Philistines did so; and they took two cows that had calved for the first time, and yoked them to the waggon, and shut up their calves at home.
11. And they set the ark of the Lord, and the coffer, and the golden mice, on the waggon.
12. And the cows went straight on the way to the way of Baethsamys, they went along one track; and laboured, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left, and the lords of the Philistines went after it as far as the coasts of Baethsamys.
13. And the men of Baethsamys were reaping the wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark of the Lord, and rejoiced to meet it.
14. And the waggon entered into the field of Osee, which was in Baethsamys, and they set there by it a great stone; and they split the wood of the waggon, and offered up the cows for a whole burnt offering to the Lord.
15. And the Levites brought up the ark of the Lord, and the coffer with it, and the golden articles upon it, and placed them on the great stone, and the men of Baethsamys offered whole burnt offerings and meat offerings on that day to the Lord.
16. And the five lords of the Philistines saw, and returned to Ascalon in that day.
17. And these are the golden tumors which the lords of the Philistines gave as a trespass-offering to the Lord; for Azotus one, for Gaza one, for Ascalon one, for Geth one, for Accaron one.
18. And the golden mice according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines, belonging to the five lords, from the fenced city to the village of the Pherezite, and to the great stone, on which they placed the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that was in the field of Osee the Baethsamysite.
19. And the sons of Jechonias were not pleased with the men of Baethsamys, because they saw the ark of the Lord; and the Lord struck among them seventy men, and fifty thousand men: and the people mourned, because the Lord had inflicted on the people, a very great plague.
20. And the men of Baethsamys said, Who shall be able to pass before this holy Lord God? and to whom shall the ark of the Lord go up from us?
21. And they send messengers to the inhabitants of Cariathiarim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of the Lord, go down and take it home to yourselves.
** 7
1. And the men of Cariathiarim come, and bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord: and they bring it into the house of Aminadab in the hill; and they sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
2. And it came to pass from the time that the ark was in Cariathiarim, the days were multiplied, and the time was twenty years; and all the house of Israel looked after the Lord.
3. And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you° do with all your heart return to the Lord, take away the strange gods from the midst of you, and the groves, and prepare your hearts to serve the Lord, and serve him only; and he shall deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.
4. And the children of Israel took away Baalim and the groves of Astaroth, and served the Lord only.
5. And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Massephath, and I will pray for you to the Lord.
6. And they were gathered together to Massephath, and they drew water, and poured it out upon the earth before the Lord. And they fasted on that day, and said, We have sinned before the Lord. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Massephath.
7. And the Philistines heard that all the children of Israel were gathered together to Massephath: and the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel: and the children of Israel heard, and they feared before the Philistines.
8. And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry to the Lord your God for us, and he shall save us out of the hand of the Philistines.
9. And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it up as a whole burnt offering with all the people to the Lord: and Samuel cried to the Lord for Israel, and the Lord heard him.
10. And Samuel was offering the whole burnt offering; and the Philistines drew near to war against Israel; and the Lord thundered with a mighty sound in that day upon the Philistines, and they were confounded and overthrown before Israel.
11. And the men of Israel went forth out of Massephath, and pursued the Philistines, and struck them to the parts under Baethchor.
12. And Samuel took a stone, and set it up between Massephath and the old city; and he called the name of it Abenezer, stone of the helper; and he said, Hitherto has the Lord helped us.
13. So the Lord humbled the Philistines, and they did not anymore come into the border of Israel; and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
14. And the cities which the Philistines took from the children of Israel were restored; and they restored them to Israel from Ascalon to Azob: and they took the coast of Israel out of the hand of the Philistines; and there was peace between Israel and the Amorite.
15. And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
16. And he went year by year, and went round Baethel, and Galgala, and Massephath; and he judged Israel in all these consecrated places.
17. And his return was to Armathaim, because there was his house; and there he judged Israel, and built there an altar to the Lord.
** 8
1. And it came to pass when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
2. And these are the names of his sons; Joel the firstborn, and the name of the second Abia, judges in Bersabee.
3. And his sons did not walk in his way; and they turned aside after gain, and took gifts, and perverted judgments.
4. And the men of Israel gather themselves together, and come to Armathaim to Samuel,
5. and they said to him, Behold, you are grown old, and your sons walk not in your way; and now set over us a king to judge us, as also the other nations have.
6. And the thing was evil in the eyes of Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us: and Samuel prayed to the Lord.
7. And the Lord said to Samuel, Hear the voice of the people, in whatever they shall say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from reigning over them.
8. According to all their doings which they have done to me, from the day that I brought them out of Egypt until this day, even as they have deserted me, and served other gods, so they do also to you.
9. And now listen to their voice; only you shall solemnly testify to them, and you shall describe to them the manner of the king who shall reign over them.
10. And Samuel spoke every word of the Lord to the people who asked of him a king.
11. And he said, This shall be the manner of the king that shall rule over you: he shall take your sons, and put them in his chariots, and among his horsemen, and running before his chariots,
12. and his manner shall be to make them to himself captains of hundreds and captains of thousands; and to reap his harvest, and gather his vintage, and prepare his instruments of war, and the implements of his chariots.
13. And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and cooks, and bakers.
14. And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your good olive yards, and give them to his servants.
15. And he will take the tithe of your seeds and your vineyards, and give it to his eunuchs, and to his servants.
16. And he will take your servants, and your handmaids, and your good herds and your asses, and will take the tenth of them for his works.
17. And he will tithe your flocks; and you° shall be his servants.
18. And you° shall cry out in that day because of your king whom you° have chosen to yourselves, and the Lord shall not hear you in those days, because you° have chosen to yourselves a king.
19. But the people would not listen to Samuel; and they said to him, Nay, but there shall be a king over us.
20. An we also will be like all the nations; and our king shall judge us, and shall go out before us, and fight our battles.
21. And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and spoke them in the ears of the Lord.
22. And the Lord said to Samuel, Listen to their voice, and appoint them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Let each man depart to his city.
** 9
1. And there was a man of the sons of Benjamin, and his name was Kis, the son of Abiel, the son of Jared, the son of Bachir, the son of Aphec, the son of a Benjamite, a man of might.
2. And this man had a son, and his name was Saul, of great stature, a goodly man; and there was not among the sons of Israel a goodlier than he, high above all the people from his shoulders and upward.
3. And the asses of Kis the father of Saul were lost; and Kis said to Saul his son, Take with you one of the young men, and arise you°, and go seek the asses.
4. And they went through mount Ephraim, and they went through the land of Selcha, and found them not: and they passed through the land of Segalim, and they were not there: and they passed through the land of Jamin, and found them not.
5. And when they came to Siph, then Saul said to his young man that was with him, Come and let us return, lest my father leave the asses, and take care for us.
6. And the young man said to him, Behold now, there is a man of God in this city, and the man is of high repute; all that he shall speak will surely come to pass: now then let us go, that he may tell us our way on which we have set out.
7. And Saul said to his young man that was with him, Behold, then, we will go; but what shall we bring the man of God? for the loaves are spent out of our vessels, and we have nothing more with us that belongs to us to bring to the man of God.
8. And the young man answered Saul again, and said, Behold, there is found in my hand a fourth part of a shekel of silver; and you shall give it to the man of God, and he shall tell us our way.
9. Now before time in Israel every one in going to enquire of God said, Come and let us go to the seer; for the people beforetime called the prophet, the seer.
10. And Saul said to his servant, Well said, come and let us go: and they went to the city where the man of God was.
11. As they went up the ascent to the city, they find damsels come out to draw water, and they say to them, Is the seer here?
12. And the virgins answered them, and they say to them, He is: behold, he is before you: now he is coming to the city, because of the day, for today there is a sacrifice for the people in Bama.
13. As soon as you° shall enter into the city, so shall you° find him in the city, before he goes up to Bama to eat; for the people will not eat until he comes in, for he blesses the sacrifice, and afterwards the guests eat; now then go up, for you° shall find him because of the holiday.
14. And they go up to the city; and as they were entering into the midst of the city, behold, Samuel came out to meet them, to go up to Bama.
15. And the Lord uncovered the ear of Samuel one day before Saul came to him, saying,
16. At this time to-morrow I will send to you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be ruler over my people Israel, and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon the humiliation of my people, for their cry is come to me.
17. And Samuel looked upon Saul, and the Lord answered him, Behold the man of whom I spoke to you, this one shall rule over my people.
18. And Saul drew near to Samuel into the midst of the city, and said, Tell me now which is the house of the seer?
19. And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am he: go up before me to Bama, and eat with me today, and I will send you away in the morning, and I will tell you all that is in your heart.
20. And concerning your asses that have been lost now these three days, care not for them, for they are found. And to whom does the excellency of Israel belong? does it not to you and to your father's house?
21. And Saul answered and said, Am not I the son of a Benjamite, the least tribe of the people of Israel? and of the least family of the whole tribe of Benjamin? and why have you spoken to me according to this word?
22. And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them to the inn, and set them there a place among the chief of those that were called, about seventy men.
23. And Samuel said to the cook, Give me the portion which I gave you, which I told you to set by you.
24. Now the cook had boiled the shoulder, and he set it before Saul; and Samuel said to Saul, Behold that which is left: set before you, an eat; for it is set you for a testimony in preference to the others; take of it: and Saul ate with Samuel on that day.
25. And he went down from Bama into the city; and they prepared a lodging for Saul on the roof, and he lay down.
26. An it came to pass when the morning dawned, that Samuel called Saul on the roof, saying, Rise up, and I will dismiss you. And Saul arose, and he and Samuel went out.
27. As they went down to a part of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Speak to the young man, and let him pass on before us; and do you stand as today, and listen to the word of God.
** 10
1. And Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said to him, Has not the Lord anointed you for a ruler over his people, over Israel? and you shall rule among the people of the Lord, and you shall save them out of the hand of their enemies; and this shall be the sign to you that the Lord has anointed you for a ruler over his inheritance.
2. As soon as you shall have departed this day from me, you shall find two men by the burial-place of Rachel on the mount of Benjamin, exulting greatly; and they shall say to you, The asses are found which you° went to seek; and, behold, your father has given up the matter of the asses, and he is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
3. And you shall depart thence, and shall go beyond that as far as the oak of Thabor, and you shall find there three men going up to God to Baethel, one bearing three kids, and another bearing three vessels of bread, and another bearing a bottle of wine.
4. And they shall ask you how you do, and shall give you two presents of bread, and you shall receive them of their hand.
5. And afterward you shall go to the hill of God, where is the encampment of the Philistines; there is Nasib the Philistine: an it shall come to pass when you° shall have entered into the city, that you shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the Bama; and before them will be lutes, and a drum, and a pipe, and a harp, and they shall prophesy.
6. And the Spirit of the Lord shall come upon you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.
7. And it shall come to pass when these signs shall come upon you, —then do you whatever your hand shall find, because God is with you.
8. And you shall go down in front of Galgal, and behold, I come down to you to offer a whole burnt offering and peace-offerings: seven days shall you wait until I shall come to you, and I will make known to you what you shall do.
9. And it came to pass when he turned his back to depart from Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all these signs came to pass in that day.
10. And he comes thence to the hill, and behold a band of prophets opposite to him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied in the midst of them.
11. And all that had known him before came, and saw, and behold, he was in the midst of the prophets: and the people said every one to his neighbor, What is this that has happened to the son of Kis? is Saul also among the prophets?
12. And one of them answered and said, And who is his father? and therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
13. And he ceased prophesying, and comes to the hill.
14. And his kinsman said to him and to his servant, Whither went you°? and they said, To seek the asses; and we saw that they were lost, and we went in to Samuel.
15. And his kinsman said to Saul, Tell me, I pray you, What did Samuel say to you?
16. And Saul said to his kinsman, he verily told me that the asses were found. But the matter of the kingdom he told him not.
17. And Samuel summoned all the people before the Lord to Massephath.
18. And he said to the children of Israel, Thus has the Lord God of Israel spoken, saying, I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, and I rescued you out of the hand of Pharao king of Egypt, and out of all the kingdoms that afflicted you.
19. And you° have this day rejected God, who is himself your Deliverer out of all your evils and afflictions; and you° said, Nay, but you shall set a king over us: and now stand before the Lord according to your tribes, and according to your families.
20. And Samuel brought near all the tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin is taken by lot.
21. And he brings near the tribe of Benjamin by families, and the family of Mattari is taken by lot: and they bring near the family of Mattari, man by man, and Saul the son of Kis is taken; and he sought him, but he was not found.
22. And Samuel asked yet again of the Lord, Will the man come here? and the Lord said, Behold, he is hid among the stuff.
23. And he ran and took him thence, and he set him in the midst of the people; and he was higher than all the people by his shoulders and upwards.
24. And Samuel said to all the people, Have you° seen whom the Lord has chosen to himself, that there is none like to him among you all? And all the people took notice, and said, Let the king live!
25. And Samuel told the people the manner of the king, and wrote it in a book, and set it before the Lord: and Samuel sent away all the people, and each went to his place.
26. And Saul departed to his house to Gabaa; and there went with Saul mighty men whose hearts God had touched.
27. But evil men said, Who is this man that shall save us? and they despised him, and brought him no gifts.
** 11
1. And it came to pass about a month after this, that Naas the Ammanite went up, and encamped against Jabis Galaad: and all the men of Jabis said to Naas the Ammanite, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.
2. Naas the Ammanite said to them, On these terms will I make a covenant with you, that I should put out all your right eyes, and I will lay a reproach upon Israel.
3. And the men of Jabis say to him, Allow us seven days, and we will send messengers into all the coasts of Israel: if there should be no one to deliver us, we will come out to you.
4. And the messengers came to Gabaa to Saul, and they speak the words into the ears of the people; and all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
5. And, behold, Saul came after the early morning out of the field: and Saul said, Why does the people week? and they tell him the words of the men of Jabis.
6. And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly kindled against them.
7. And he took two cows, and cut them in pieces, and sent them into all the coasts of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoso comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall they do to his oxen: and a transport from the Lord came upon the people of Israel, and they came out to battle as one man.
8. And he reviews them at Bezec in Bama, every man of Israel six hundred thousand, and the men of Juda seventy thousand.
9. And he said to the messengers that came, Thus shall you° say to the men of Jabis, To-morrow you° shall have deliverance when the sun is hot; and the messengers came to the city, and told the men of Jabis, and they rejoiced.
10. And the men of Jabis said to Naas the Ammanite, To-morrow we will come forth to you, and you° shall do to us what seems good in your sight.
11. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Saul divided the people into three companies, and they go into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and they struck the children of Ammon until the day was hot; at it came to pass that those who were left were scattered, and there were not left among them two together.
12. And the people said to Samuel, Who has said that Saul shall not reign over us? Give up the men, and we will put them to death.
13. And Saul said, No man shall die this day, for today the Lord has wrought deliverance in Israel.
14. And Samuel spoke to the people, saying, Let us go to Galgala, and there renew the kingdom.
15. And all the people went to Galgala, and Samuel anointed Saul there to be king before the Lord in Galgala, and there he offered meat-offerings and peace-offerings before the Lord: and Samuel and all Israel rejoiced exceedingly.
** 12
1. And Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have listened to your voice in all things that you° have said to me, and I have set a king over you.
2. And now, behold, the king goes before you; and I am grown old and shall rest; and, behold, my sons are among you; and, behold, I have gone about before you from my youth to this day.
3. Behold, here am I, answer against me before the Lord and before his anointed: whose calf have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom of you have I oppressed? or from whose hand have I taken a bribe, even to a sandal? bear witness against me, and I will make restitution to you.
4. And they said to Samuel, You have not injured us, and you have not oppressed us; and you have not afflicted us, and you have not taken anything from any one's hand.
5. And Samuel said to the people, The Lord is witness among you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you° have not found anything in my hand: and they said, He is witness.
6. And Samuel spoke to the people, saying, The Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron is witness, who brought our fathers up out of Egypt.
7. And now stand still, and I will judge you before the Lord; and I will relate to you all the righteousness of the Lord, the things which he has wrought among you and your fathers.
8. When Jacob and his sons went into Egypt, and Egypt humbled them, then our fathers cried to the Lord, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron; and they brought our fathers out of Egypt, and he made them to dwell in this place.
9. And they forgot the Lord their God, and he sold them into the hands of Sisara captain of the host of Jabis king of Asor, and into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the king of Moab; and he fought with them.
10. And they cried to the Lord, and said, We have sinned, for we have forsaken the Lord, and have served Baalim and the groves: and now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.
11. And he sent Jerobaal, and Barac, and Jephthae, and Samuel, and rescued us out of the hand of our enemies round about, and you° lived in security.
12. And you° saw that Naas king of the children of Ammon came against you, and you° said, Nay, none but a king shall reign over us; whereas the Lord our God is our king.
13. And now behold the king whom you° have chosen; and behold, the Lord has set a king over you.
14. If you° should fear the Lord, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not resist the mouth of the Lord, and you° and your king that reigns over you should follow the Lord, well.
15. But if you° should not listen to the voice of the Lord, and you° should resist the mouth of the Lord, then shall the hand of the Lord be upon you and upon your king.
16. And now stand still, and see this great thing, which the Lord will do before your eyes.
17. Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the Lord, and he shall send thunder and rain; and know you° and see, that your wickedness is great which you° have wrought before the Lord, having asked for yourselves a king.
18. And Samuel called upon the Lord, and the Lord sent thunders and rain in that day; and all the people feared greatly the Lord and Samuel.
19. And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to the Lord your God, and let us not die; for we have added to all our sins this iniquity, in asking for us a king.
20. And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: you° have indeed wrought all this iniquity; only turn not from following the Lord, and serve the Lord with all your heart.
21. And turn not aside after the gods that are nothing, who will do nothing, and will not deliver you, because they are nothing.
22. For the Lord will not cast off his people for his great name's sake, because the Lord graciously took you to himself for a people.
23. And far be it from me to sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you: but I will serve the Lord, and show you the good and the right way.
24. Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth and with all your heart, for you° see what great things he has wrought with you.
25. But if you° continue to do evil, then shall you° and your king be consumed.
** 13
.1-2 And Saul chooses for himself three thousand men of the men of Israel: and there were with Saul two thousand who were in Machmas, and in mount Baethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gabaa of Benjamin: and he sent the rest of the people every man to his tent.
3. And Jonathan struck Nasib the Philistine that lived in the hill; and the Philistines hear of it, and Saul sounds the trumpet through all the land, saying, The servants have despised us.
4. And all Israel heard say, Saul has struck Nasib the Philistine; now Israel had been put to shame before the Philistines; and the children of Israel went up after Saul in Galgala.
5. And the Philistines gather together to war with Israel; and then come up against Israel thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand by the seashore for multitude: and they come up, and encamp in Machmas, opposite Baethoron southward.
6. And the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait so that they could not draw near, and the people hid themselves in caves, and sheepfolds, and rocks, and ditches, and pits.
7. And they that went over went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Galaad: and Saul was yet in Galgala, and all the people followed after him in amazement.
8. And he continued seven days for the appointed testimony, as Samuel told him, and Samuel came not to Galgala, and his people were dispersed from him.
9. And Saul said, Bring hither victims, that I may offer whole burnt offerings and peace-offerings: and he offered the whole burnt offering.
10. And it came to pass when he had finished offering the whole burnt offering, that Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to meet him, and to bless him.
11. And Samuel said, What have you done? and Saul said, Because I saw how the people were scattered from me, and you was not present as you purposed according to the set time of the days, and the Philistines were gathered to Machmas.
12. Then I said, Now will the Philistines come down to me to Galgala, and I have not sought the face of the Lord: so I forced myself and offered the whole burnt offering.
13. And Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly; for you have not kept my command, which the Lord commanded you, as now the Lord would have confirmed your kingdom over Israel for ever.
14. But now your kingdom shall not stand to you, and the Lord shall seek for himself a man after his own heart; and the Lord shall appoint him to be a ruler over his people, because you have not kept all that the Lord commanded you.
15. And Samuel arose, and departed from Galgala, and the remnant of the people went after Saul to meet him after the men of war, when they had come out of Galgala to Gabaa of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were found with him, about six hundred men.
16. And Saul and Jonathan his son, and the people that were found with them, halted in Gabaa, of Benjamin; and they wept: and the Philistines had encamped in Machmas.
17. And men came forth to destroy out of the land of the Philistines in three companies; one company turning by the way of Gophera toward the land of Sogal,
18. and another company turning the way of Baethoron, and another company turning by the way of Gabae that turns aside to Gai of Sabim.
19. And there was not found a smith in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make themselves sword or spear.
20. And all Israel went down to the Land of the Philistines to forge every one his reaping-hook and his tool, and every one his axe and his sickle.
21. And it was near the time of vintage: and their tools were valued at three shekels for a plowshare, and there was the same rate for the axe and the sickle.
22. And it came to pass in the days of the war of Machmas, that there was not a sword or spear found in the hand of all the people, that were with Saul and Jonathan; but with Saul and Jonathan his son was there found.
23. And there went out some from the camp of the Philistines to the place beyond Machmas.
** 14
1. And when a certain day arrived, Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to Messab of the Philistines that is on the other side yonder; but he told not his father.
2. And Saul sat on the top of the hill under the pomegranate tree that is in Magdon, and there were with him about six hundred men.
3. And Achia son of Achitob, the brother of Jochabed the son of Phinees, the son of Heli, was the priest of God in Selom wearing an ephod: and the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
4. And in the midst of the passage whereby Jonathan sought to pass over to the encampment of the Philistines, there was both a sharp rock on this side, and a sharp rock on the other side: the name of the one was Bases, and the name of the other Senna.
5. The one way was northward to one coming to Machmas, and the other way was southward to one coming to Gabae.
6. And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, let us go over to Messab of these uncircumcised, if perhaps the Lord may do something for us; for the Lord is not straitened to save by many or by few.
7. And his armor-bearer said to him, Do all that your heart inclines toward: behold, I am with you, my heart is as your heart.
8. And Jonathan said, Behold, we will go over to the men, and will come down suddenly upon them.
9. If they should say thus to us, Stand aloof there until we shall send you word; then we will stand still by ourselves, and will not go up against them.
10. But if they should say thus to us, Come up to us; then will we go up, for the Lord has delivered them into our hands; this shall be a sign to us.
11. And they both went in to Messab of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of their Caves, where they had hidden themselves.
12. And the men of Messab answered Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing: and Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, Come up after me, for the Lord has delivered them into the hands of Israel.
13. And Jonathan went up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer with him; and they looked on the face of Jonathan, and he struck them, and his armor-bearer did strike them after him.
14. And the first slaughter which Jonathan and his armor-bearer effected was twenty men, with darts and slings, and pebbles of the field.
15. And there was dismay in the camp, and in the field; and all the people in Messab, and the spoilers were amazed; and they would not act, and the land was terror-struck, and there was dismay from the lord.
16. And the watchmen of Saul [*]saw in Gabaa of Benjamin, and, behold, the army was thrown into confusion on every side.
17. And Saul said to the people with him, Number yourselves now, and see who has gone out from you: and they numbered themselves, and behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not found.
18. And Saul said to Achia, Bring the ephod; for he wore the ephod in that day before Israel.
19. And it came to pass while Saul was speaking to the priest, that the sound in the camp of the Philistines continued to increase greatly; and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hands.
20. And Saul went up and all the people that were with him, and they come to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his neighbor, a very great confusion.
21. And the servants who had been before with the Philistines, who had gone up to the army, turned themselves also to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
22. And all the Israelites who were hidden in mount Ephraim heard also that the Philistines fled; and they also gather themselves after them to battle: and the Lord saved Israel in that day; and the war passed through Bamoth; and all the people with Saul were about ten thousand men.
23. And the battle extended itself to every city in the mount Ephraim.
24. And Saul committed a great trespass of ignorance in that day, and he lays a curse on the people, saying, Cursed is the man who shall eat bread before the evening; so I will avenge myself on my enemy: and none of the people tasted bread, though all the land was dining.
25. And Jaal was a wood abounding in swarms of bees on the face of the ground.
26. And the people went into the place of the bees, and, behold, they continued speaking; and, behold, there was none that put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath of the Lord.
27. And Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people; and he reached forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, an dipped it into the honeycomb, and returned his hand to his mouth, and his eyes recovered their sight.
28. And one of the people answered and said, Your father solemnly adjured the people, saying, Cursed is the man who shall eat bread today. And the people were very faint,
29. and Jonathan knew it, and said, My father has destroyed the land: see how my eyes have received sight now that I have tasted a little of this honey.
30. Surely if the people had this day eaten freely of the spoils of their enemies which they found, the slaughter among the Philistines would have been greater.
31. And on that day he struck some of the Philistines in Machmas; and the people were very weary.
32. And the people turned to the spoil; and the people took flocks, and herds, and calves, and killed them on the ground, and the people ate with the blood.
33. And it was reported to Saul, saying, The people have sinned against the Lord, eating with the blood: and Saul said, Out of Getthaim roll a great stone to me hither.
34. And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them to bring hither every one his calf, and every one his sheep: and let them kill it on this stone and sin not against the Lord in eating with the blood: and the people brought each one that which was in his hand, and they killed them there.
35. And Saul built an altar there to the Lord: this was the first altar that Saul built to the Lord.
36. And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines this night, and let us plunder among them till the day break, and let us not leave a man among them. And they said, Do all that is good in your sight: and the priest said, let us draw near hither to God.
37. And Saul enquired of God, If I go down after the Philistines, will you deliver them into the hands of Israel? And he answered him not in that day.
38. And Saul said, Bring hither all the chiefs of Israel, and know and see by whom this sin has been committed this day.
39. For as the Lord lives who has saved Israel, if answer should be against my son Jonathan, he shall surely die. And there was no one that answered out of all the people.
40. And he said to all the men of Israel, You° shall be under subjection, and I an Jonathan my son will be under subjection: and the people said to Saul, Do that which is good in your sight.
41. And Saul said, O Lord God of Israel, why have you not answered your servant this day? is the iniquity in me, or in Jonathan my son? Lord God of Israel, give clear manifestations; and if the lot should declare this, give, I pray you, to your people of Israel, give, I pray, holiness. And Jonathan and Saul are taken, and the people escaped.
42. And Saul said, Cast lots between me and my son Jonathan: whoever the Lord shall cause to be taken by lot, let him die: and the people said to Saul, This thing is not to be done: and Saul prevailed against the people, and they cast lots between him and Jonathan his son, and Jonathan is taken by lot.
43. And Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done: and Jonathan told him, and said, I did indeed taste a little honey, with the end of my staff that was in my hand, and, behold! I am to die.
44. And Saul said to him, God do so to me, and more also, you shall surely die today.
45. And the people said to Saul, Shall he that has wrought this great salvation in Israel be put to death this day? As the Lord lives, there shall not fall to the ground one of the hairs of his head; for the people of God have wrought successfully this day. And the people prayed for Jonathan in that day, and he died not.
46. And Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines departed to their place.
47. And Saul received the kingdom, by lot he inherits the office of ruling over Israel: and he fought against all his enemies round about, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against the children of Edom, and against Baethaeor, and against the king of Suba, and against the Philistines: wherever he turned, he was victorious.
48. And he wrought valiantly, and struck Amalec, and rescued Israel out of the hand of them that trampled on him.
49. And the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Jessiu, and Melchisa: and these were the names of his two daughters, the name of the firstborn Merob, and the name of the second Melchol.
50. And the name of his wife was Achinoom, the daughter of Achimaa: and the name of his captain of the host was Abenner, the son of Ner, son of a kinsman of Saul.
51. And Kis was the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abenezer, was son of Jamin, son of Abiel.
52. And the war was vehement against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man, and any valiant man, then he took them to himself.
** 15
1. And Samuel said to Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint you king over Israel: and now hear the voice of the Lord.
2. Thus said the Lord of hosts, Now will I take vengeance for what Amalec did to Israel, when he met him in the way as he came up out of Egypt.
3. And now go, and you shall strike Amalec and Hierim and all that belongs to him, and you shall not save anything of him alive, but you shall utterly destroy him: and you shall devote him and all his to destruction, and you shall spare nothing belonging to him; and you shall kill both man and woman, and infant and suckling, and calf and sheep, and camel and ass.
4. And Saul summoned the people, and he numbered them in Galgala, four hundred thousand regular troops, and Juda thirty thousand regular troops.
5. And Saul came to the cities of Amalec, and laid wait in the valley.
6. And Saul said to the Kinite, Go, and depart out of the midst of the Amalekites, lest I put you with them; for you dealt mercifully with the children of Israel when they went up out of Egypt. So the Kinite departed from the midst of Amalec.
7. And Saul struck Amalec from Evilat to Sur fronting Egypt.
8. And he took Agag the king of Amalec alive, and he killed all the people and Hierim with the edge of the sword.
9. And Saul and all the people saved Agag alive, and the best of the flocks, and of the herds, and of the fruits, of the vineyards, and of all the good things; and they would not destroy them: but every worthless and refuse thing they destroyed.
10. And the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying,
11. I have repented that I have made Saul to be king: for he has turned back from following me, and has not kept my word. And Samuel was grieved, and cried to the Lord all night.
12. And Samuel rose early and went to meet Israel in the morning, and it was told Saul, saying, Samuel has come to Carmel, and he has raised up help for himself: and he turned his chariot, and came down to Galgala to Saul; and, behold, he was offering up a whole burnt offering to the Lord, the chief of the spoils which he brought out of Amalec.
13. And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said to him, Blessed are you of the Lord: I have performed all that the Lord said.
14. And Samuel said, What then is the bleating of this flock in my ears, and the sound of the oxen which I hear?
15. And Saul said, I have brought them out of Amalec, that which the people preserved, even the best of the sheep, and of the cattle, that it might be sacrificed to the Lord your God, and the rest have I utterly destroyed.
16. And Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what the Lord has said to me this night: and he said to him, Say on.
17. And Samuel said to Saul, Are you not little in his eyes, though a leader of one of the tribes of Israel? and yet the Lord anointed you to be king over Israel.
18. And the Lord sent you on a journey, and said to you, Go, and utterly destroy: you shall kill the sinners against me, even the Amalekites; and you shall war against them until you have consumed them.
19. And why did not you listen to the voice of the Lord, but did haste to fasten upon the spoils, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord?
20. And Saul said to Samuel, Because I listened to the voice of the people: yet I went the way by which the Lord sent me, and I brought Agag the king of Amalec, and I destroyed Amalec.
21. But the people took of the spoils the best flocks and herds out of that which was destroyed, to sacrifice before the Lord our God in Galgal.
22. And Samuel said, Does the Lord take pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in hearing the words of the Lord? behold, obedience is better than a good sacrifice, and hearkening than the fat of rams.
23. For sin is as divination; idols bring on pain and grief. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord also shall reject you from being king over Israel.
24. And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, in that I have transgressed the word of the Lord and your direction; for I feared the people, and I listened to their voice.
25. And now remove, I pray you, my sin, and turn back with me, and I will worship the Lord your God.
26. And Samuel said to Saul, I will not turn back with you, for you have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord will reject you from being king over Israel.
27. And Samuel turned his face to depart, and Saul caught hold of the skirt of his garment, and tore it.
28. And Samuel said to him, The Lord has tore your kingdom from Israel out of your hand this day, and will give it to your neighbor who is better than you.
29. And Israel shall be divided to two: and God will not turn nor repent, for he is not as a man to repent.
30. And Saul said, I have sinned; yet honor me, I pray you, before the elders of Israel, and before my people; and turn back with me, and I will worship the Lord your God.
31. So Samuel turned back after Saul, and he worshipped the Lord.
32. And Samuel said, Bring me Agag the king of Amalec: and Agag came to him trembling; and Agag said Is death thus bitter?
33. And Samuel said to Agag, As your sword has bereaved women of their children, so shall your mother be made childless among women: and Samuel killed Agag before the Lord in Galgal.
34. And Samuel departed to Armathaim, and Saul went up to his house at Gabaa.
35. And Samuel did not see Saul again till the day of his death, for Samuel mourned after Saul, and the Lord repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
** 16
1. And the Lord said to Samuel, How long do you mourn for Saul, whereas I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and come, I will send you to Jessae, to Bethleem; for I have seen among his sons a king for me.
2. And Samuel said, How can I go? whereas Saul will hear of it, and kill me: and the Lord said, Take a heifer in your hand and you shall say, I am come to sacrifice to the Lord.
3. And you shall call Jessae to the sacrifice, and I will make known to you what you shall do; and you shall anoint him whom I shall mention to you.
4. And Samuel did all that the Lord told him; and he came to Bethleem: and the elders of the city were amazed at meeting him, and said, Do you come peaceably, you Seer?
5. And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice to the Lord. Sanctify yourselves, and rejoice with me this day: and he sanctified Jessae and his sons, and he called them to the sacrifice.
6. And it came to pass when they came in, that he saw Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord's anointed is before him.
7. But the Lord said to Samuel, Look not on his appearance, nor on his stature, for I have rejected him; for God sees not as man looks; for man looks at the outward appearance, but God looks at the heart.
8. And Jessae called Aminadab, and he passed before Samuel: and he said, Neither has God chosen this one.
9. And Jessae caused Sama to pass by: and he said, Neither has God chosen this one.
10. And Jessae caused his seven sons to pass before Samuel: and Samuel said, the Lord has not chosen these.
11. And Samuel said to Jessae, Hast you no more sons? And Jessae said, There is yet a little one; behold, he tends the flock. And Samuel said to Jessae, Send and fetch him for we may not sit down till he comes.
12. And he sent and fetched him: and he was ruddy, with beauty of eyes, and very goodly to behold. And the Lord said to Samuel, Arise, and anoint David, for he is good.
13. And Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward: and Samuel arose, and departed to Armathaim.
14. And the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented him.
15. And Saul's servants said to him, Behold now, and evil spirit from the Lord torments you.
16. Let now your servants speak before you, and let them seek for our lord a man skilled to play on the harp; and it shall come to pass when an evil spirit comes upon you and he shall play on his harp, that you shall be well, and he shall refresh you.
17. And Saul said to his servants, Look now out for me a skillful player, and bring him to me.
18. And one of his servants answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jessae the Bethleemite, and he understands playing on the harp, and the man is prudent, and a warrior, and wise in speech, and the man is handsome, and the Lord is with him.
19. And Saul sent messengers to Jessae, saying, Send to me your son David who is with your flock.
20. And Jessae took a homer of bread, and a bottle of wine, and one kid of the goats, and sent them by the hand of his son David to Saul.
21. And David went in to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor-bearer.
22. And Saul sent to Jessae, saying, Let David, I pray you, stand before me, for he has found grace in my eyes.
23. And it came to pass when the evil spirit was upon Saul, that David took his harp, and played with his hand: and Saul was refreshed, and it was well with him, and the evil spirit departed from him.
** 17
1. And the Philistines gather their armies to battle, and gather themselves to Socchoth of Judaea, and encamp between Socchoth and Azeca Ephermen.
2. And Saul and the men of Israel gather together, and they encamp in the valley, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.
3. And the Philistines stand on the mountain on one side, and Israel stands on the mountain on the other side, and the valley was between them.
4. And there went forth a mighty man out of the army of the Philistines, Goliath, by name, out of Geth, his height was four cubits and a span.
5. And he had a helmet upon his head, and he wore a breastplate of chain armor; and the weight of his breastplate was five thousand shekels of brass and iron.
6. And greaves of grass were upon his legs, and a brazen target was between his shoulders.
7. And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the spear's head was formed of six hundred shekels of iron; and his armor-bearer went before him.
8. And he stood and cried to the army of Israel, and said to them, Why are you° come forth to set yourselves in battle array against us? Am not I a Philistine, and you° Hebrews of Saul? Choose for yourselves a man, and let him come down to me.
9. And if he shall be able to fight against me, and shall strike me, then will we be your servants: but if I should prevail and strike him, you° shall be our servants, and serve us.
10. And the Philistine said, Behold, I have defied the armies of Israel this very day: give me a man, and we will both of us fight in single combat.
11. And Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, and they were dismayed, and greatly terrified.
12. And David son of an Ephrathite said, this Eplarathite was of Bethleem Juda, and his name was Jessae, and he had eight sons. And the man passed for an old man among men in the days of Saul.
13. And the three elder sons of Jessae went and followed Saul to the war, and the names of his sons that went to the war were, Eliab his ﬁrst-born, and his second Aminadab, and his third son Samma.
14. And David himself was the younger son, and the three elder followed Saul.
15. And David departed and returned from Saul, to feed his father’s sheep in Bethleem;
16. And the Philistine advanced morning and evening, and stood up forty days.
17. And Jessae said to David, Take now to your brethren an ephah of this meal, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp and give them to your brothers.
18. And you shall carry to the captain of the thousand these ten cheeses of milk, and you shall see how your brethren fare, and learn what they lack.
19. And Saul himself and all the men of Israel were in the valley of the Oak, warring with the Philistines.
20. And David rose early in the morning, and left the sheep to a keeper, and took and went as Jessae commanded him, and he came to the trench and to the army as it was going out to ﬁght, and they shouted for the battle.
21. And Israel and the Philistines formed their lines one opposite the other.
22. And David deposited his burden in the hand of a keeper, and ran to the line, and went and asked his brethren how they Were.
23. And while he was speaking with them, behold the Amessaean advanced, Goliath by name, the Philistine of Geth, of the armies of the Philistines, and he spoke as before, and David heard.
24. And all the men of Israel when they saw the man ﬂed from before him, and they were greatly terrified.
25. And the men of Israel said, Have you° seen this man that comes up? for he has reproached Israel and has come up; and it shall be that the man who shall strike him, the king shall enrich him with great wealth and shall give him his daughter, and shall make his father’s house free in Israel.
26. and David spoke to the men who stood with him saying, Shall it indeed be done thus to the man who shall strike that Philistine, and take away reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he has defied the army of the living God?
27. And the people spoke to him according to this Word, saying Thus shall it be done to the man Who shall strike him.
28. And Eliab his elder brother heard as he spoke to the men, and Eliab was very angry with David and said, Why have you thus come down, and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the naughtiness of your heart, for you are come down to see the battle.
29. And David said what have I done now? Have I no business here?
30. And he turned from him towards another, and he spoke after the same manner; and the people answered him after the former manner.
31. And the Words which David spoke were heard and were reported to Saul. And he took him to himself.
32. And David said to Saul, Let not, I pray you, the heart of my lord be dejected within him: your servant will go, and fight with this Philistine.
33. And Saul said to David, You will not in anyway be able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are a mere youth, and he a man of war from his youth.
34. And David said to Saul, Your servant was tending the flock for his father; and when a lion came and a she-bear, and took a sheep out of the flock,
35. then I went forth after him, and struck him, and drew the spoil out of his mouth: and as he rose up against me, then I caught hold of his throat, and struck him, and killed him.
36. Your servant struck both the lion and the bear, and the uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them: shall I not go and strike him, and remove this day a reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised one, who has defied the army of the living God?
37. The Lord who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this uncircumcised Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and the Lord shall be with you.
38. And Saul clothed David with a military coat, and put his brazen helmet on his head.
39. And he girded David with his sword over his coat: and he made trial walking with them once and again: and David said to Saul, I shall not be able to go with these, for I have not proved them: so they remove them from him.
40. And he took his staff in his hand, and he chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's scrip which he had for his store, and his sling was in his hand; and he approached the Philistine.
41. And the Philistine advanced and drew near to David, and a man bearing his shield went before him, and the Philistine looked on.
42. And Goliath saw David, and despised him; for he was a lad, and ruddy, with a fair countenance.
43. And the Philistine said to David, Am I as a dog, that you come against me with a staff and stones? and David said, Nay, but worse than a dog. And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
44. And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth.
45. And David said to the Philistine, You come to me with sword, and with spear, and with shield; but I come to you in the name of the Lord God of hosts of the army of Israel, which you have defied
46. this day. And the Lord shall deliver you this day into my hand; and I will kill you, and take away your head from off you, and will give your limbs and the limbs of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky, and to the wild beasts of the earth; and all the earth shall know that there is a God in Israel.
47. And all this assembly shall know that the Lord delivers not by sword or spear, for the battle is the Lord's, and the Lord will deliver you into our hands.
48. And the Philistine arose and went to meet David.
49. And David stretched out his hand to his scrip, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead, and the stone penetrated through the helmet into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the ground.
50. So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him, and there was no sword in the hand of David.
51. And David ran, and stood upon him, and took his sword, and killed him, and cut off his head: and the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, and they fled.
52. And the men of Israel and Juda arose, and shouted and pursued them as far as the entrance to Geth, and as far as the gate of Ascalon: and the slain men of the Philistines fell in the way of the gates, both to Geth, and to Accaron.
53. And the men of Israel returned from pursuing after the Philistines, and they destroyed their camp.
54. And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.
55. And when Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abener the captain of the host, Whose son is this youth? and Abener said, As your sould lives, O King, I know not.
56. And the king said, Do you ask whose son this youth is.
57. And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abener took him and brought him before Saul, and the head of the Philistine was in his hand.
58. And Saul said to him, Whose son are you, young man? and David said, The son of your servant Jessae the Bethleemite.
** 18
1. And it came to pass when he had finished speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David and David loved him as his own soul.
2. And Saul took him in that day, and did not suffer him to return to his father's house.
3. And Jonathan and David made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul.
4. And Jonathan stripped himself of his upper garment, and gave it to David, and his mantle and all he had upon him, even to his sword and to his bow, and to his girdle.
5. And David went out withersoever Saul sent him, and acted wisely, and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was pleasing in the eyes of all the people, and also in the eyes of the servants of Saul.
6. And there came out women in dances to meet David out of all the cities of Israel, with timbrels, and with rejoicing, and with cymbals.
7. And the women began the strain, and said, Saul has struck his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
8. And it seemed evil in the eyes of Saul concerning this matter, and he said, To David they have given ten thousands, and to me they have given thousands. And what more can he have but the kingdom?
9. And Saul eyed David from that day and onward.
10. And it came to pass on the morrow that an evil spirit from God fell upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of his house. And David was playing on the harp with his hand, according to his daily custom. And Saul’s spear was in his hand.
11. And Saul took his spear and said, I will strike David even to the wall. But David escaped twice from his presence.
12. And Saul was alarmed on account of David.
13. And he removed him from him, and made him a captain of a thousand for himself; and he went out and came in before the people.
14. And David was prudent in all his ways, and the Lord was with him.
15. And Saul saw that he was very wise, and he was afraid of him.
16. And all Israel and Juda loved David, because he came in and went out before the people.
17. And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merob, I will give her to you to Wife, only be you to me a mighty man and ﬁght the wars of the Lord. And Saul said, Let not my hand be upon him, but the hand of the Philistines shall be upon him.
18. And David said to Saul, Who am I, and What is the life of my father’s family in Israel, that I should be the king’s son—in-law?
19. But it came to pass at the time when Merob Saul’s daughter should have been given to David, that she was given to Israel the Mothulathite to wife.
20. And Melchol the daughter of Saul loved David; and it was told Saul, and the thing was pleasing in his eyes.
21. And Saul said, I will give her to him, and she shall be a stumbling block to him. Now the hand of the Philistines was against Saul.
22. And Saul charged his servants, saying, Speak you° privately to David, saying, Behold, the king delights in you, and all his servants love you, and do you becomes the king's son-in-law.
23. And the servants of Saul spoke these words in the ears of David; and David said, Is it a light thing in your eyes to become son-in-law to the king? Whereas I am an humble man, an not honorable?
24. And the servants of Saul reported to him according to these words, which David spoke.
25. And Saul said, Thus shall you° speak to David, The king wants no gift but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to avenge himself on the kings enemies. Now Saul thought to cast him into the hands of the Philistines.
26. And the servants of Saul report these words to David, and David was well pleased to become the son-in-law to the king.
27. And David arose, and went, he and his men, and struck among the Philistines a hundred men: and he brought their foreskins, and he becomes the king's son-in-law, and Saul gives him Melchol his daughter to wife.
28. And Saul saw that the Lord was with David, and that all Israel loved him.
29. And he was yet more afraid of David.
30. And the chief of the Philistines went forth; and it came to pass that from the suficiency of their expedition David acted Wisely above all the servants of Saul; and his name was honored exceedingly.
** 19
1. And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, to kill David.
2. And Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David much: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul seeks to kill you: take heed to yourself therefore to-morrow morning, and hide yourself, and dwell in secret.
3. And I will go forth, and stand near my father in the field where you shall be, and I will speak concerning you to my father; and I will see what his answer may be, and I will tell you.
4. And Jonathan spoke favorably concerning David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against your servant David, for he has not sinned against you, and his deeds are very good.
5. And he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine, and the Lord wrought a great deliverance; and all Israel saw, and rejoined: why then do you sin against innocent blood, to kill David without a cause?
6. And Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan; and Saul swore, saying, As the Lord lives, he shall not die.
7. And Jonathan called David, and told him all these words; and Jonathan brought David in to Saul, and he was before him as in former times.
8. And there was again war against Saul; and David did valiantly, and fought against the Philistines, and struck them with a very great slaughter, and they fled from before him.
9. And an evil spirit from God was upon Saul, and he was resting in his house, and a spear was in his hand, and David was playing on the harp with his hands.
10. And Saul sought to strike David with the spear; and David withdrew suddenly from the presence of Saul; and he drove the spear into the wall; and David retreated and escaped.
11. And it came to pass in that night, that Saul sent messengers to the house of David to watch him, in order to kill him in the morning; and Melchol David's wife told him, saying, Unless you save your life this night, to-morrow you shall be slain.
12. So Melchol lets David down by the window, and he departed, and fled, and escaped.
13. And Melchol took images, and laid them on the bed, and she put the liver of a goat by his head, and covered them with clothes.
14. And Saul sent messengers to take David; and they say that he is sick.
15. And he sends to David, saying, Bring him to me on the bed, that I may kill him.
16. And the messengers come, and, behold, the images were on the bed, and the goat's liver at his head.
17. And Saul said to Melchol, Why have you thus deceived me, and suffered my enemy to depart, and he has escaped? and Melchol said to Saul, He said, let me go, and if not, I will kill you.
18. So David fled, and escaped, and comes to Samuel to Armathaim, and tells him all that Saul had done to him: and Samuel and David went, and lived in Navath in Rama.
19. And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is in Navath in Rama.
20. And Saul sent messengers to take David, and they saw the assembly of the prophets, and Samuel stood as appointed over them; and the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they prophesy.
21. And it was told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied: and Saul sent again a third set of messengers, and they also prophesied.
22. And Saul was very angry, and went himself also to Armathaim, and he comes as far as the well of the threshing floor that is in Sephi; and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And they said, Behold, in Navath in Rama.
23. And he went thence to Navath in Rama: and there came the Spirit of God upon him also, and he went on prophesying till he came to Navath in Rama.
24. And he took off his clothes, and prophesied before them; and lay down naked all that day and all that night: therefore they said, Is Saul also among the prophets?
** 20
1. And David fled from Navath in Rama, and comes into the presence of Jonathan; and he said, What have I done, and what is my fault, and wherein have I sinned before your father, that he seeks my life?
2. And Jonathan said to him, Far be it from you: you shall not die: behold, my father will not do any thing great or small without discovering it to me; and why should my father hide this matter from me? This thing is not so.
3. And David answered Jonathan, and said, Your father knows surely that I have found grace in your sight, and he said, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he refuse his consent: but as the Lord lives and your soul lives, as I said, the space is filled up between me and death.
4. And Jonathan said to David, What does your soul desire, and what shall I do for you.
5. And David said to Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow is the new moon, and I shall not on any account sit down to eat, but you shall let me go, and I will hide in the plain till the evening.
6. And if your father do in anyway enquire for me, then shall you say, David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethleem his city, for there is there, a yearly sacrifice for all the family.
7. If he shall say thus, Well, — all is safe for your servant: but if he shall answer harshly to you, know that evil is determined by him.
8. And you shall deal mercifully with your servant; for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the Lord with yourself: and if there is iniquity in your servant, kill me yourself; but why do you thus bring me to your father?
9. And Jonathan said, That be far from you: for if I surely know that evil is determined by my father to come upon you, although it should not be against your cities, I will tell you.
10. And David said to Jonathan, Who can tell me if your father should answer roughly?
11. And Jonathan said to David, Go, and abide in the field. And they went out both into the field.
12. And Jonathan said to David, the Lord God of Israel knows that I will sound my father as I have an opportunity, three several times, and, behold, if good should be determined concerning David, and I do not send to you to the field,
13. God do so to Jonathan and more also: as I shall also report the evil to you, and make it known to you, and I will let you go; and you shall depart in peace, and the Lord shall be with you, as he was with my father.
14. And if indeed I continue to live, then shall you deal mercifully with me; and if I indeed die,
15. you shall not withdraw your mercy from my house for ever: and if you do not, when the Lord cuts off the enemies of David each from the face of the earth,
16. should it happen that the name of Jonathan be discovered by the house of David, then let the Lord seek out the enemies of David.
17. And Jonathan swore yet again to David, because he loved the soul of him that loved him.
18. And Jonathan said, To-morrow is the new moon, and you will be enquired for, because your seat will be observed as vacant.
19. And you shall stay three days, and watch an opportunity, and shall come to your place where you may hide yourself in the day of your business, and you shall wait by that stone Ezel.
20. And I will shoot three arrows, aiming them at a mark.
21. And behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go find me the arrow.
22. If I should expressly say to the lad, The arrow is here, and on this side of you, take it; then come, for it is well with you, and there is no reason for fear, as the Lord lives: but if I should say thus to the young man, The arrow is on that side of you, and beyond; go, for the Lord has sent you away.
23. And as for the word which you and I have spoken, behold, the Lord is witness between me and you for ever.
24. So David hides himself in the field, and the new month arrives, and the king comes to the table to eat.
25. And he sat upon his seat as in former times, even on his seat by the wall, and he went before Jonathan; and Abenner sat on one side of Saul, and the place of David was empty.
26. And Saul said nothing on that day, for he said, It seems to have fallen out that he is not clean, because he has not purified himself.
27. And it came to pass on the morrow, on the second day of the month, that the place of David was empty; and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has not the son of Jessae attended both yesterday and today at the table?
28. And Jonathan answered Saul, and said to him, David asked leave of me to go as far as Bethleem his city;
29. and he said, Let me go, I pray you, for we have a family sacrifice in the city, and my brethren have sent for me; and now, if I have found grace in your eyes, I will even go over and see my brethren: therefore he is not present at the table of the king.
30. And Saul was exceedingly angry with Jonathan, and said to him, You son of traitorous damsels! for do I not know that you are an accomplice with the son of Jessae to your same, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?
31. For so long as the son of Jessae lives upon the earth, your kingdom shall not be established: now then send and take the young man, for he shall surely die.
32. And Jonathan answered Saul, Why is he to die? What has he done?
33. And Saul lifted up his spear against Jonathan to kill him: so Jonathan knew that this evil was determined on by his father to kill David.
34. And Jonathan sprang up from the table in great anger, and did not eat bread on the second day of the month, for he grieved bitterly for David, because his father determined on mischief against him.
35. And morning came, and Jonathan went out to the field, as he appointed to do for a signal to David, and a little boy was with him.
36. And he said to the boy, Run, find me the arrows which I shoot: and the boy ran, and Jonathan shot an arrow, and sent it beyond him.
37. And the boy came to the place where the arrow was which Jonathan shot; and Jonathan cried out after the lad, and said, The arrow is on that side of you and beyond you.
38. And Jonathan cried out after his boy, saying, Make all speed, and stay not. And Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and brought the arrows to his master.
39. And the boy knew nothing, only Jonathan and David knew.
40. And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to his boy, Go, enter into the city.
41. And when the lad went in, then David arose from the south, and fell upon his face, and did obeisance to him three times, and they kissed each other, and wept for each other, for a great while.
42. And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, and as we have both sworn in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord shall be witness between me and you, and between my seed and your seed for ever—even so let it be. And David arose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.
** 21
1. And David comes to Nomba to Abimelech the priest: and Abimelech was amazed at meeting him, and said to him, Why are you alone, and nobody with you?
2. And David said to the priest, The king gave me a command today, and said to me, Let no one know the matter on which I send you, an concerning which I have charged you: and I have charged my servants to be in the place that is called, The faithfulness of God, Phellani Maemoni.
3. And now if there are under your hand five loaves, give into my hand what is ready.
4. And the priest answered David, and said, There are no common loaves under my hand, for I have none but holy loaves: if the young men have been kept at least from women, then they shall eat them.
5. And David answered the priest, and said to him, Yes, we have been kept from women for three days: when I came forth for the journey all the young men were purified; but this expedition is unclean, therefore it shall be sanctified this day because of my weapons.
6. So Abimelech the priest gave him the show bread; for there were no loaves there, but only the presence loaves which had been removed from the presence of the Lord, in order that hot bread should be set on, on the day on which he took them.
7. And there was there on that day one of Saul's servants detained before the Lord, and his name was Doec the Syrian, tending the mules of Saul.
8. And David said to Abimelech, See if there is here under your hand spear or sword, for I have not brought in my hand my sword or my weapons, for the word of the king was urgent.
9. And the priest said, Behold the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck in the valley of Ela; and it is wrapt in a cloth: if you will take it, take it for yourself, for there is no other except it here. And David said, Behold, there is none like it; give it me.
10. And he gave it him; and David arose, and fled in that day from he presence of Saul: and David came to Anchus king of Geth.
11. And the servants of Anchus said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? Did not the dancing women begin the son to him, saying, Saul has struck his thousand, and David his ten thousands?
12. And David laid up the words in his heart, and was greatly afraid of Anchus king of Geth.
13. And he changed his appearance before him, and feigned himself a false character in that day; and drummed upon the doors of the city, and used extravagant gestures with his hands, and fell against the doors of the gate, and his spittle ran down upon his beard.
14. And Anchus said to his servants, Behold! you° see the man is mad: why have you° brought him in to me?
15. Am I in lack of madmen, that you° have brought him in to me to play the madman? He shall not come into the house.
** 22
1. And David departed thence, and escaped; and he comes to the cave of Odollam, and his brethren hear, and the house of his father, and they go down to him there.
2. And there gathered to him every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was troubled in mind; and he was a leader over them, and there were with him about four hundred men.
3. And David departed thence to Massephath of Moab, and said to the king of Moab, Let, I pray you, my father and my mother be with you, until I know what God will do to me.
4. And he persuaded the King of Moab, and they dwell with him continually, while David was in the hold.
5. And Gad the prophet said to David, Dwell not in the hold: go, and you shall enter the land of Juda. So David went, and came and lived in the city of Saric.
6. And Saul heard that David was discovered, and his men with him: now Saul lived in the hill below the field that is in Rama, and his spear was in his hand, and all his servants stood near him.
7. And Saul said to his servants that stood by him, Hear now, you° sons of Benjamin, will the son of Jessae indeed give all of you fields and vineyards, and will he make you all captains of hundreds and captains of thousands?
8. That you° are conspiring against me, and there is no one that informs me, whereas my son has made a covenant with the son of Jessae, and there is no one of you that is sorry for me, or informs me, that my son has stirred up my servant against me for an enemy, as it is this day?
9. And Doec the Syrian who was over the mules of Saul answered and said, I saw the son of Jessae as he came to Nomba to Abimelech son of Achitob the priest.
10. And the priest enquired of God for him, and gave him provision, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
11. And the king sent to call Abimelech son of Achitob and all his father's sons, the priests that were in Nomba; and they all came to the king.
12. And Saul said, Hear now, you son of Achitob. And he said, Behold! I am here, speak, my lord.
13. And Saul said to him, Why have you and the son of Jessae conspired against me, that you should give him bread and a sword, and should enquire of God for him, to raise him up against me as an enemy, as he is this day?
14. And he answered the king, and said, And who is there among all your servants faithful as David, and he is a son-in-law of the king, and he is executor of all your commands, and is honorable in your house?
15. Have I begun today to enquire of God for him? By no means: let not the king bring a charge against his servant, and against you whole of my father's house; for your servant knew not in all these matters anything great or small.
16. And king Saul said, You shall surely die, Abimelech, you, and all your father's house.
17. And the king said to the footmen that attended on him, Draw near and kill the priests of the Lord, because their hand is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and they did not inform me. But the servants of the king would not lift their hands to fall upon the priest of the Lord.
18. And the king said to Doec, Turn you, and fall upon the priests: and Doec the Syrian turned, and killed the priests of the Lord in that day, three hundred and five men, all wearing an ephod.
19. And he struck Nomba the city of the priest with the edge of the sword, both man, and woman, infant and suckling, and calf, and ox, and sheep.
20. And one son of Abimelech son of Achitob escapes, and his name was Abiathar, and he fled after David.
21. And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain all the priests of the Lord.
22. And David said to Abiathar, I knew it in that day, that Doec the Syrian would surely tell Saul: I am guilty of the death of the house of your father.
23. Dwell with me; fear not, for wherever I shall seek a place of safety for my life, I will also seek a place for your life, for you are safely guarded while with me.
** 23
1. And it was told David, saying, behold, the Philistines war in Keila, and they rob, they trample on the threshing-floors.
2. And David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and strike these Philistines? And the Lord said, Go, and you shall strike these Philistines, and shall save Keila.
3. And the men of David said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judea; and how shall it be if we go to Keila? Shall we go after the spoils of the Philistines?
4. And David enquired yet again of the Lord; and the Lord answered him, and said to him, Arise and go down to Keila, for I will deliver the Philistines into your hands.
5. So David and his men with him went to Keila, and fought with the Philistines; and they fled from before him, and he carried off their cattle, and struck them with a great slaughter, and David rescued the inhabitants of Keila.
6. And it came to pass when Abiathar the son of Achimelech fled to David, that he went down with David to Keila, having and ephod in his hand.
7. And it was told Saul that David was come to Keila: and Saul said, God has sold him into my hands, for he is shut up, having entered into a city that has gates and bars.
8. And Saul charged all the people to go down to war to Keila, to besiege David and his men.
9. And David knew that Saul spoke openly of mischief against him: and David said to Abiathar the priest, Bring the ephod of the Lord.
10. And David said, Lord God of Israel, your servant has indeed heard, that Saul seeks to come against Keila to destroy the city on my account.
11. Will the place be shut up? And now will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? Lord God of Israel, tell your servant.
12. And the Lord said, It will be shut up.
13. And David arose, and the men with him, in number about four hundred, and they went forth from Keila, and went wherever they could go: and it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keila, and he forbore to come.
14. And he lived in Maserem in the wilderness, in the narrow passes; and lived in the wilderness in mount Ziph, in the dry country. And Saul sought him continually, but the Lord delivered him not into his hands.
15. And David perceived that Saul went forth to seek David; and David was in the dry mountain in the New Ziph.
16. And Jonathan son of Saul rose, and went to David to Caene, and strengthened his hands in the Lord.
17. And he said to him, Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be second to you; and Saul my father knows it.
18. So they both made a covenant before the Lord; and David lived in Caene, and Jonathan went to his home.
19. And the Ziphites came up out of the dry country to Saul to the hill, saying, Behold, is not David hidden with us in Messara, in the narrows in Caene in the hill of Echela, which is on the right of Jessaemon?
20. And now according to all the king's desire to come down, let him come down to us; they have shut him up into the hands of the king.
21. And Saul said to them, Blessed be you° of the Lord, for you° have been grieved on my account.
22. Go, I pray you, and make preparations yet, and notice his place where his foot shall be, quickly, in that place which you° spoke of, lest by any means he should deal craftily.
23. Take notice, then, and learn, and I will go with you; and it shall come to pass that if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Juda.
24. And the Ziphites arose, and went before Saul: and David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, westward, to the right of Jessaemon.
25. And Saul and his men went to seek him: and they brought word to David, and he went down to the rock that was in the wilderness of Maon: and Saul heard, and followed after David to the wilderness of Maon.
26. And Saul and his men go on one side of the mountain, and David and his men are on the other side of the mountain: and David was hiding himself to escape from Saul: and Saul and his men encamped against David and his men, in order to take them.
27. And there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste you, and come here, for the Philistines have invaded the land.
28. So Saul returned from following after David, and went to meet the Philistines: therefore that place was called The divided Rock.
** 24
1. And David rose up from thence, and lived in the narrow passes of Engaddi.
2. And it came to pass when Saul returned from pursuing after the Philistines, that it was reported to him, saying, David is in the wilderness of Engaddi.
3. And he took with him three thousand men, chosen out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men in front of Saddaeem.
4. And he came to the flocks of sheep that were by the way, and there was a cave there; and Saul went in to make preparation, and David and his men were sitting in the inner part of the cave.
5. And the men of David said to him, Behold, this is the day of which the Lord spoke to you, that he would deliver your enemy into your hands; and you shall do to him as it is good in your sight. So David arose and cut off the skirt of Saul's garment secretly.
6. And it came to pass after this that David's heart struck him, because he had cut off the skirt of his garment.
7. And David said to his men, The Lord forbid it me, that I should do this ting to my lord the anointed of the Lord, to lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the Lord.
8. So David persuaded his men by his words, and did not suffer them to arise and kill Saul: and Saul arose and went his way.
9. And David rose up and went after him out of the cave: and David cried after Saul, saying, My lord, O king! and Saul looked behind him, and David bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance to him.
10. And David said to Saul, Why do you listen to the words of the people, saying, Behold, David seeks your life?
11. Behold, your eyes have seen this day how that the Lord has delivered you this day into my hands in the cave; and I would not kill you, but spared you, and said, I will not lift up my hand against my lord, for he is the Lord's anointed.
12. And behold, the skirt of your mantle is in my hand, I cut off the skirt, and did not kill you: know then and see today, there is no evil in my hand, nor impiety, nor rebellion; and I have not sinned against you, yet you lay snares for my soul to take it.
13. The Lord judge between me and you, and the Lord requite you on yourself: but my hand shall not be upon you.
14. As the old proverb says, Transgression will proceed from the wicked ones: but my hand shall not be upon you.
15. And now after whom do you come forth, O king of Israel? After whom do you pursue? After a dead dog, and after a flea?
16. The Lord be judge and umpire between me and you, the Lord look upon and judge my cause, and rescue me out of your hand.
17. And it came to pass when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, Son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
18. And Saul said to David, You are more righteous that I, for you have recompensed me good, but I have recompensed you evil.
19. And you have told me today what good you have done me, how the Lord shut me up into your hands today, and you did not kill me.
20. And if any one should find his enemy in distress, and should send him forth in a good way, then the Lord will reward him good, as you have done this day.
21. And now, behold, I know that you shall surely reign, and the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.
22. Now then swear to me by the Lord, that you will not destroy my seed after me, that you will not blot out my name from the house of my father.
23. So David swore to Saul: and Saul departed to his place, and David and his men went up to the strong-hold of Messera.
** 25
1. And Samuel died, and all Israel assembled, and bewailed him, and they bury him in his house in Armathaim: and David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Maon.
2. And there was a man in Maon, and his flocks were in Carmel, and he was a very great man; and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand she-goats: and he happened to be shearing his flock in Carmel.
3. And the man's name was Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigaia: and his wife was of good understanding and very beautiful in person: but the man was harsh, and evil in his doings, and the man was churlish.
4. And David heard in the wilderness, that Nabal the Carmelite was shearing his sheep.
5. And David sent ten young men, and he said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and ask him in my name how he is.
6. And thus shall you° say, May you and your house seasonably prosper, and all your be in prosperity.
7. And now, behold, I have heard that your shepherds who were with is in the wilderness are shearing your sheep, and we hindered them not, neither did we demand any thing from them all the time they were in Carmel.
8. Ask your servants, and they will tell you. Let then your servants find grace in your eyes, for we are come on a good day; give we pray you, whatever your hand may find, to your son David.
9. So the servants come and speak these words to Nabal, according to all these words in the name of David.
10. And Nabal sprang up, and answered the servants of David, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jessae? Now-a-days there is abundance of servants who depart every one from his master.
11. And shall I take my bread, and my wine, and my beasts that I have slain for my shearers, and shall I give them to men of whom I know not whence they are?
12. So the servants of David turned back, and returned, and came and reported to David according to these words.
13. And David said to his men, Gird on every man his sword. And they went up after David, about four hundred men: and two hundred abode with the stuff.
14. And one of the servants reported to Abigaia the wife of Nabal, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our lord; but he turned away from them.
15. And the men were very good to us; they did not hinder us, neither did they demand from us any thing all the days that we were with them.
16. And when we were in the field, they were as a wall round about us, both by night and by day, all the days that we were with them feeding the flock.
17. And now do you consider, and see what you will do; for mischief is determined against our lord and against his house; and he is a vile character, and one can’t speak to him.
18. And Abigaia hasted, and took two hundred loaves, and two vessels of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five ephahs of fine flour, and one homer of dried grapes, and two hundred cakes of figs, and put them upon asses.
19. And she said to her servants, Go on before me, and behold I come after you: but she told not her husband.
20. And it came to pass when she had mounted her ass and was going down by the covert of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down to meet her, and she met them.
21. And David said, Perhaps I have kept all his possessions in the wilderness that he should wrong me, and we did not order the taking anything of all his goods; yet he has rewarded me evil for good.
22. So God do to David and more also, if I leave one male of all that belong to Nabal until the morning.
23. And Abigaia saw David, and she hasted and alighted from her ass; and she felt before David on her face, and did obeisance to him, bowing to the ground
24. even to his feet, and said, On me, my lord, be my wrong: let, I pray you, your servant speak in your ears, and hear you the words of your servant.
25. Let not my lord, I pray you, take to heart this pestilent man, Nabal' for according to his name, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I your handmaid saw not the servants of my lord whom you did send.
26. And now, my lord, as the Lord lives, and your soul lives, as the Lord has kept you from coming against innocent blood, and from executing vengeance for yourself, now therefore let your enemies, and those that seek evil against my lord, become as Nabal.
27. And now accept this token of goodwill, which your servant has brought to my lord, and you shall give it to the servants that wait on my lord.
28. Remove, I pray you, the trespass of your servant; for the Lord will surely make for my lord a sure house, for the Lord fights the battles of my lord, and there shall no evil be ever found in you.
29. And if a man shall rise up persecuting you and seeking your life, yet shall the life of my lord be bound up in the bundle of life with the Lord God, and you shall whirl the life of your enemies as in the midst of a sling.
30. And it shall be when the Lord shall have wrought for my lord all the good things he has spoken concerning you, and shall appoint you to be ruler over Israel;
31. then this shall not be an abomination and offense to my lord, to have shed innocent blood without cause, and for my lord to have avenged himself: and so may the Lord do good to my lord, and you shall remember your handmaid to do her good.
32. And David said to Abigaia, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who sent you this very day to meet me:
33. and blessed be your conduct, and blessed be you, who have hindered me this very day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself.
34. But surely as the Lord God of Israel lives, who hindered me this day from doing you harm, if you had not hasted and come to meet me, then I said, There shall surely not be left to Nabal till the morning one male.
35. And David took of her hand all that she brought to him, and said to her, Go in peace to your house: see, I have listened to your voice, and accepted your petition.
36. And Abigaia came to Nabal: and, behold, he had a banquet in this house, as the banquet of a king, and the heart of Nabal was merry within him, and he was very drunken: and she told him nothing great or small till the morning light.
37. And it came to pass in the morning, when Nabal recovered from his wine, his wife told him these words; and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
38. And it came to pass after about ten days, that the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.
39. And David heard it and said, Blessed be the Lord, who has judged the cause of my reproach at the hand of Nabal, and has delivered his servant from the power of evil; and the Lord has returned the mischief of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and spoke concerning Abigaia, to take her to himself for a wife.
40. So the servants of David came to Abigaia to Carmel, and spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to you, to take you to himself for a wife.
41. And she arose, and did reverence with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, your servant is for an handmaid to wash the feet of your servants.
42. And Abigaia arose, and mounted her ass, and five damsels followed her: and she went after the servants of David, and became his wife.
43. And David took Achinaam out of Jezrael, and they were both his wives.
44. And Saul gave Melchol his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Amis who was of Romma.
** 26
1. And the Ziphites come out of the dry country to Saul to the hill, saying, Behold, David hides himself with us in the hill Echela, opposite Jessemon.
2. And Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and with him went three thousand men chosen out of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
3. And Saul encamped in the hill of Echela in front of Jessemon, by the way, and David lived in the wilderness: and David saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
4. And David sent spies, and ascertained that Saul was come prepared out of Keila.
5. And David arose secretly, and goes into the place where Saul was sleeping, and there was Abenner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul was sleeping in a chariot, and the people had encamped along round about him.
6. And David answered and spoke to Abimelech the Chettite, and to Abessa the son Saruia the brother of Joab, saying, Who will go in with me to Saul into the camp? And Abessa said, I will go in with you.
7. So David and Abessa go in among the people by night: and behold, Saul was fast asleep in the chariot, and his spear was stuck in the ground near his head, and Abenner and his people slept round about him.
8. And Abessa said to David, The Lord has this day shut up your enemy into your hands, and now I will to him. strike him to the earth with the spear to the ground once for all, and I will not strike him again.
9. And David said to Abessa, Do not lay him low, for who shall lift up his hand against the anointed of the Lord, and be guiltless?
10. And David said, As the Lord lives, if the Lord strike him not, or his day come and he die, or he go down to battle and be added to his fathers, do not so.
11. The Lord forbid it me that I should lift up my hand against the anointed of the Lord: and now take, I pray you, the spear from his bolster, and the pitcher of water, and let us return home.
12. So David took the spear, and the pitcher of water from his bolster, and they went home: and there was no one that saw, and no one that knew, and there was no one that awoke, all being asleep, for a stupor from the Lord had fallen upon them.
13. So David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off, and there was a good distance between them.
14. And David called to the people, and spoke to Abenner, saying, Will you not answer, Abenner? and Abenner answered and said, Who are you that call?
15. And David said to Abenner, Are not you a man? and who is like you in Israel? Why then do you not guard your lord the king? for one out of the people went in to destroy your lord the king.
16. And this thing is not good which you have done. As the Lord lives, you° are worthy of death, you° who guard your lord the king, the anointed of the Lord: and now behold, I pray you, the spear of the king, and the cruse of water: where are the articles that should be at his head?
17. And Saul recognized the voice of David, and said, Is this your voice, son David? and David said, I am your servant, my lord, O king.
18. And he said, Why does my lord thus pursue after his servant? for in what have I sinned? and what unrighteousness has been found in me?
19. And now let my lord the king hear the word of his servant. If God stirs you up against me, let your offering be acceptable: but if the sons of men, they are cursed before the Lord, for they have cast me out this day so that I should not be established in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other Gods.
20. And now let not my blood fall to the ground before the Lord, for the king of Israel has come forth to seek your life, as the night hawk pursues its prey in the mountains.
21. And Saul said, I have sinned: turn, son David, for I will not hurt you, because my life was precious in your eyes; and today I have been foolish and have erred exceedingly.
22. And David answered and said, Behold, the spear of the king: let one of the servants come over and take it.
23. And the Lord shall recompense each according to his righteousness and his truth, since the Lord delivered you this day into my hands, and I would not lift my hand against the Lord's anointed.
24. And, behold, as your life has been precious this very day in my eyes, so let my life be precious before the Lord, and may he protect me, and deliver me out of all affliction.
25. And Saul said to David, Blessed be you, my son; and you shall surely do valiantly, and surely prevail. And David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
** 27
1. And David said in his heart, Now shall I be one day delivered for death into the hands of Saul; and there is no good thing for me unless I should escape into the land of the Philistines, and Saul should cease from seeking me through every coast of Israel: so I shall escape out of his hand.
2. So David arose, and the six hundred men that were with him, and he went to Anchus, son Ammach, king of Geth.
3. And David lived with Anchus, he and his men, each with his family; and David and both his wives, Achinaam, the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
4. And it was told Saul that David had fled to Geth; and he no longer sought after him.
5. And David said to Anchus, If now your servant has found grace in your eyes, let them give me, I pray you, a place in one of the cities in the country, and I will dwell there: for why does your servant dwell with you in a royal city?
6. And he gave him Sekelac in that day: therefore Sekelac came into possession of the king of Judea to this day.
7. And the number of the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was four months.
8. And David and his men went up, and made an attack on all the Gesirites and on the Amalekites: and behold, the land was inhabited, (even the land from Gelampsur) by those who come from the fortified cities even to the land of Egypt.
9. And he struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive; and they took flocks, and herds, and asses, and camels, and raiment; and they returned and came to Anchus.
10. And Anchus said to David, On whom have you° made an attack today? And David said to Anchus, On the south of Judea, and on the south of Jesmega, and on the south of the Kenezite.
11. And I have not saved man or woman alive to bring them to Geth, saying, Lest they carry a report to Geth against us, saying, These things David does. And this was his manner all the days that David lived in the country of the Philistines.
12. So David had the full confidence of Anchus, who said, He is thoroughly disgraced among his people in Israel and he shall be my servant for ever.
** 28
1. And it came to pass in those days that the Philistines gathered themselves together with their armies to go out to fight with Israel; and Anchus said to David, Know surely, that you shall go forth to battle with me, you, and your men.
2. And David said to Anchus, Thus now you shall know what your servant will do. And Anchus said to David, So will I make you captain of my body-guard continually.
3. And Samuel died, and all Israel lamented for him, and they bury him in his city, in Armathaim. And Saul had removed those who had in them divining spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
4. And the Philistines assemble themselves, and come and encamp in Sonam: and Saul gathers all the men of Israel, and they encamp in Gelbue.
5. And Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, and he was alarmed, and his heart was greatly dismayed.
6. And Saul enquired of the Lord; and the Lord answered him not by dreams, nor by manifestations, nor by prophets.
7. Then Saul said to his servants, Seek for me a woman who has in her a divining spirit, and I will go to her, and enquire of her: and his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has in her a divining spirit at Aendor.
8. And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he goes, and two men with him, and they come to the woman by night; and he said to her, Divine to me, I pray you, by the divining spirit within you, and bring up to me him whom I shall name to you.
9. And the woman said to him, Behold now, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who had in them divining spirits, and the wizards from the land, and why do you spread a snare for my life to destroy it?
10. And Saul swore to her, and said, As the Lord lives, no injury shall come upon you on this account.
11. And the woman said, Whom shall I bring up to you? and he said, Bring up to me Samuel.
12. And the woman saw Samuel, and cried out with a loud voice: and the woman said to Saul, Why have you deceived me? for you are Saul.
13. And the king said to her, Fear not; tell me whom you have seen. And the woman said to him, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.
14. And he said to her, What did you perceive? and she said to him, An upright man ascending out of the earth, and he was clothed with a mantle. And Saul knew that this was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the earth, and did obeisance to him.
15. And Samuel said, Why have you troubled me, that I should come up? And Saul said, I am greatly distressed, and the Philistines war against me, and God has departed from me, and no longer hearkens to me either by the hand of the prophets or by dreams: and now I have called you to tell me what I shall do.
16. And Samuel said, Why asked you me, whereas the Lord has departed from you, and taken part with your neighbor?
17. And the Lord has done to you, as the Lord spoke by me; and the Lord will rend your kingdom out of your hand, and will give it to your neighbor David.
18. because you did not listen to the voice of the Lord, and did not execute his fierce anger upon Amalec, therefore the Lord has done this thing to you this day.
19. And the Lord shall deliver Israel with you into the hands of the Philistines, and to-morrow you and your sons with you shall fall, and the Lord shall deliver the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.
20. And Saul instantly fell at his full length upon the earth, and was greatly afraid because of the words of Samuel; and there was no longer any strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all that day, and all that night.
21. And the woman went in to Saul, and saw that he was greatly disquieted, and said to him, Behold now, your handmaid has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have heard the words which you have spoken to me.
22. And now listen, I pray you, to the voice of your handmaid, and I will set before you a morsel of bread, and eat, and you shall be strengthened, for you will be going on your way.
23. But he would not eat; so his servants and the woman constrained him, and he listened to their voice, and rose up from the earth, and sat upon a bench.
24. And the woman had a fat heifer in the house; and she hasted and killed it; and she took meal and kneaded it, and baked unleavened cakes.
25. And she brought the meat before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate, and rose up, and departed that night.
** 29
1. And the Philistines gather all their armies to Aphec, and Israel encamped in Aendor, which is in Jezrael.
2. And the lords of the Philistines went on by hundreds and thousands, and David and his men went on in the rear with Anchus.
3. And the lords of the Philistines said, Who are these that pass by? And Anchus said to the captains of the Philistines, Is not this David the servant of Saul king of Israel? He has been with us some time, even this second year, and I have not found any fault in him from the day that he attached himself to me even until this day.
4. And the captains of the Philistines were displeased at him, and they say to him, Send the man away, and let him return to his place, where you did set him; and let him not come with us to the war, and let him not be a traitor in the camp: and wherewith will he be reconciled to his master? Will it not be with the heads of those men?
5. Is not this David whom they celebrated in dances, saying, Saul has struck his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
6. And Anchus called David, and said to him, As the Lord lives, you are right and approved in my eyes, and so is your going out and your coming in with me in the army, and I have not found any evil to charge against you from the day that you came to me until this day: but you are not approved in the eyes of the lords.
7. Now then return and go in peace, thus you shall not do evil in the sight of the lords of the Philistines.
8. And David said to Anchus, What have I done to you? and what have you found in your servant from the first day that I was before you even until this day, that I should not come and war against the enemies of the lord my king?
9. And Anchus answered David, I know that you are good in my eyes, but the lords of the Philistines say, He shall not come with us to the war.
10. Now then rise up early in the morning, you and the servants of your lord that are come with you, and go to the place where I appointed you, and entertain no evil thought in your heart, for you are good in my sight: and rise early for your journey when it is light, and depart.
11. So David arose early, he and his men, to depart and guard the land of the Philistines: and the Philistines went up to Jezrael to battle.
** 30
1. And it came to pass when David and his men had entered Sekelac on the third day, that Amalec had made an incursion upon the south, and upon Sekelac, and struck Sekelac, and burnt it with fire.
2. And as to the women and all things that were in it, great and small, they killed neither man nor woman, but carried them captives, and went on their way.
3. And David and his men came into the city, and, behold, it was burnt with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters were carried captive.
4. And David and his men lifted up their voice, and wept till there was no longer any power within them to weep.
5. And both the wives of David were carried captive, Achinaam, the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
6. And David was greatly distressed, because the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, each for his sons and his daughters: but David strengthened himself in the Lord his God.
7. And David said to Abiathar the priest the son of Achimelech, Bring near the ephod.
8. And David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? and he said to him, Pursue, for you shall surely overtake them, and you shall surely rescue the captives.
9. So David went, he an the six hundred men with him, an they come as far as the brook Bosor, and the superfluous ones stopped.
10. And he pursued them with four hundred men; and there remained behind two hundred men, who tarried on the other side of the brook Bosor.
11. And they find an Egyptian in the field, and they take him, and bring him to David; and they gave him bread and he ate, and they caused him to drink water.
12. And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and he ate, and his spirit was restored in him; for he had not eaten bread, and had not drunk water three days and three nights.
13. And David said to him, Whose are you? and whence are you? and the young man the Egyptian said, I am the servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me, because I was taken ill three days ago.
14. And we made an incursion on the south of the Chelethite, and on the parts of Judea, and on the south of Chelub, and we burnt Sekelac with fire.
15. And David said to him, Will you bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear now to me by God, that you will not kill me, and that you will not deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down upon this troop.
16. So be brought him down there, and behold, they were scattered abroad upon the surface of the whole land, eating and drinking, and feasting by reason of all the great spoils which they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Juda.
17. And David came upon them, and struck them from the morning till the evening, and on the next day; and not one of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who were mounted on camels, and fled.
18. And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and he rescued both his wives.
19. And nothing was lacking to them of great or small, either of the spoils, or the sons and daughters, or anything that they had taken of theirs; and David recovered all.
20. And he took all the flocks, and the herds, and led them away before the spoils: and it was said of these spoils, These are the spoils of David.
21. And David comes to the two hundred men who were left behind that they should not follow after David, and he had caused them to remain by the brook of Bosor; and they came forth to meet David, and to meet his people with him: and David drew near to the people, and they asked him how he did.
22. Then every ill-disposed and bad man of the soldiers who had gone with David, answered and said, Because they did not pursue together with us, we will not give them of the spoils which we have recovered, only let each one lead away with him his wife and his children, and let them return.
23. And David said, You° shall not do so, after the Lord has delivered the enemy to us, and guarded us, and the Lord has delivered into our hands the troop that came against u.
24. And who will listen to these your words? for they are not inferior to us; for according to the portion of him that went down to the battle, so shall be the portion of him that abides with the baggage; they shall share alike.
25. And it came to pass from that day forward, that it became an ordinance and a custom in Israel until this day.
26. And David came to Sekelac, and sent of the spoils to the elders of Juda, and to his friends, saying, Behold some of the spoils of the enemies of the Lord;
27. to those in Baethsur, and to those in Rama of the south, and to those in Gethor.
28. And to those in Aroer, and to those in Ammadi, and to those in Saphi, and to those in Esthie,
29. and to those in Geth, and to those in Cimath, and to those in Saphec, and to those in Themath, and to those in Carmel, and to those in the cities of Jeremeel, and to those in the cities of the Kenezite;
30. and to those in Jerimuth, and to those in Bersabee, and to those in Nombe,
31. and to those in Chebron, and to all the places which David and his men had passed through.
** 31
1. And the Philistines fought with Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and they fall down wounded in the mountain in Gelbue.
2. And the Philistines press closely on Saul and his sons, and the Philistines strike Jonathan, and Aminadab, and Melchisa son of Saul.
3. And the battle prevails against Saul, and the shooters with arrows, even the archers find him, and he was wounded under the ribs.
4. And Saul said to his armor-bearer, Draw your sword and pierce me through with it; lest these uncircumcised come and pierce me through, and mock me. But his armor-bearer would not, for he feared greatly: so Saul took his sword and fell upon it.
5. And his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, and he fell also himself upon his sword, and died with him.
6. So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor-bearer, in that day together.
7. And the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and those beyond Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead; and they leave their cities and flee: and the Philistines come and dwell in them.
8. And it came to pass on the morrow that the Philistines come to strip the dead, and they find Saul and his three sons fallen on the mountains of Gelbue.
9. And they turned him, and stripped off his armor, and sent it into the land of the Philistines, sending round glad tidings to their idols and to the people.
10. And they set up his armor at the temple of Astarte, and they fastened his body on the wall of Baethsam.
11. And the inhabitants of Jabis Galaad hear what the Philistines did to Saul.
12. And they rose up, even every man of might, and marched all night, and took the body of Saul and the body of Jonathan his son from the wall of Baethsam; and they bring them to Jabis, and burn them there.
13. And they take their bones, and bury them in the field that is in Jabis, and fast seven days.
* II Kingdoms
** 1
1. And it came to pass after Saul was dead, that David returned from striking Amalec, and David abode two days in Sekelac.
2. And it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came from the camp, from the people of Saul, and his garments were tore, and earth was upon his head: and it came to pass when he went in to David, that he fell upon the earth, and did obeisance to him.
3. And David said to him, Whence come you? and he said to him, I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.
4. And David said to him, What is the matter? tell me. And he said, The people fled out of the battle, and many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead.
5. And David said to the young man who brought him the tidings, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?
6. And the young man that brought the tidings, said to him, I happened accidentally to be upon mount Gelbue; and, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear, and, behold, the chariots and captains of horse pressed hard upon him.
7. And he looked behind him, and saw me, and called me; and I said, Behold, here am I.
8. And he said to me, Who are you? and I said, I am an Amalekite.
9. And he said to me, Stand, I pray you, over me, and kill me, for a dreadful darkness has come upon me, for all my life is in me.
10. So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew he would not live after he was fallen; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was upon his arm, and I have brought them hither to my lord.
11. And David laid hold of his garments, and tore them; and all the men who were with him tore their garments.
12. And they lamented, and wept, and fasted till evening, for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Juda, and for the house of Israel, because they were struck with the sword.
13. And David said to the young man who brought the tidings to him, Whence are you? and he said, I am the son of an Amalekite sojourner.
14. And David said to him, How was it you were not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the anointed of the Lord?
15. And David called one of his young men, and said, Go and fall upon him: and he struck him, and he died.
16. And David said to him, Your blood be upon your own head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain the anointed of the Lord.
17. And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son.
18. And he gave orders to teach it the sons of Juda: behold, it is written in the book of Right.
19. Set up a pillar, O Israel, for the slain that died upon your high places: how are the mighty fallen!
20. Tell it not in Geth, and tell it not as glad tidings in the streets of Ascalon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
21. You° mountains of Gelbue, let not dew no rain descend upon you, nor fields of first fruits be upon you, for there the shield of the mighty ones has been grievously assailed; the shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.
22. From the blood of the slain, and from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan returned not empty; and the sword of Saul turned not back empty.
23. Saul and Jonathan, the beloved and the beautiful, were not divided: comely were they in their life, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, and they were stronger than lions.
24. Daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you with scarlet together with your adorning, who added golden ornaments to your apparel.
25. How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, even the slain ones upon your high places!
26. I am grieved for you, my brother Jonathan; you were very lovely to me; your love to me was wonderful beyond the love of women.
27. How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
** 2
1. And it came to pass after this that David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up into one of the cities of Juda? and the Lord said to him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? and he said, To Chebron.
2. And David went up there to Chebron, he and both his wives, Achinaam the Jezraelitess, and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite,
3. and the men that were with him, every one and his family; and they lived in the cities of Chebron.
4. And the men of Judea come, and anoint David there to reign over the house of Juda; and they reported to David, saying, The men of Jabis of the country of Galaad have buried Saul.
5. And David sent messengers to the rulers of Jabis of the country of Galaad, and David said to them, Blessed be you° of the Lord, because you° have wrought this mercy toward your lord, even toward Saul the anointed of the Lord, and you° have buried him and Jonathan his son.
6. And now may the Lord deal in mercy and truth towards you: and I also will requite towards you this good deed, because you° have done this.
7. And now let your hands be made strong, and be valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and moreover the house of Juda have anointed me to be king over them.
8. But Abenner, the son of Ner, the commander-in-chief of Saul's army, took Jebosthe son of Saul, and brought him up from the camp to Manaem
9. and made him king over the land of Galaad, and over Thasiri, and over Jezrael, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.
10. Jebosthe, Saul's son was forty years old, when he reigned over Israel; and he reigned two years, but not over the house of Juda, who followed David.
11. And the days which David reigned in Chebron over the house of Juda were seven years and six months.
12. And Abenner the son of Ner went forth, and the servants of Jebosthe the son of Saul, from Manaem to Gabaon.
13. And Joab the son of Saruia, and the servants of David, went forth from Chebron, and met them at the fountain of Gabaon, at the same place: and these sat down by the fountain on this side, and those by the fountain on that side.
14. And Abenner said to Joab, Let now the young men arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
15. And there arose and passed over by number twelve of the children of Benjamin, belonging to Jebosthe the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.
16. And they seized every one the head of his neighbor with his hand, and his sword was thrust into the side of his neighbor, and they fall down together: and the name of that place was called The portion of the treacherous ones, which is in Gabaon.
17. And the battle was very severe on that day; and Abenner and the men of Israel were worsted before the servants of David.
18. And there were there the three sons of Saruia, Joab, and Abessa, and Asael: and Asael was swift in his feet as a roe in the field.
19. And Asael followed after Abenner, and turned not to go to the right hand or to the left from following Abenner.
20. And Abenner looked behind him, and said, Are you Asael himself? and he said, I am.
21. And Abenner said to him, Turn you to the right hand or to the left, and lay hold for yourself on one of the young men, and take to yourself his armor: but Asel would not turn back from following him.
22. And Abenner said yet again to Asael, Stand aloof from me, lest I strike you to the ground? and how should I lift up my face to Joab?
23. And what does this mean? return to Joab your brother? But he would not stand aloof; and Abenner smites him with the hinder end of the spear on the loins, and the spear went out behind him, and he falls there and dies on the spot: and it came to pass that every one that came to the place where Asael fell and died, stood still.
24. And Joab and Abessa pursued after Abenner, and the sun went down: and they went as far as the hill of Amman, which is in the front of Gai, by the desert way of Gabaon.
25. And the children of Benjamin who followed Abenner gather themselves together, and they formed themselves into one body, and stood on the top of a hill.
26. And Abenner called Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour perpetually? know you not that it will be bitter at last? How long then will you refuse to tell the people to turn from following our brethren?
27. And Joab said, As the Lord lives, if you had not spoken, even from the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.
28. And Joab sounded the trumpet, and all the people departed, and did not pursue after Israel, and did not fight any longer.
29. And Abenner and his men departed at evening, and went all that night, and crossed over Jordan, and went along the whole adjacent country, and they come to the camp.
30. And Joab returned from following Abenner, and he assembled all the people, and there were missing of the people of David, nineteen men, and Asael.
31. And the servants of David struck of the children of Benjamin, of the men of Abenner, three hundred and sixty men belonging to him.
32. And they take up Asael, and bury him in the tomb of his father in Bethleem. And Joab and the men with him went all the night, and the morning rose upon them in Chebron.
** 3
1. And there was war for a long time between the house of Saul and the house of David; and the house of David grew continually stronger; but the house of Saul grew continually weaker.
2. And sons were born to David in Chebron: and his firstborn was Ammon the son of Achinoom the Jezraelitess.
3. And his second son was Daluia, the son of Abigaia the Carmelitess; and the third, Abessalom the son of Maacha the daughter of Tholmi the king of Gessir.
4. And the fourth was Ornia, the son of Aggith, and the fifth was Saphatia, the son of Abital.
5. And the sixth was Jetheraam, the son of Aegal the wife of David. These were born to David in Chebron.
6. And it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abenner was governing the house of Saul.
7. And Saul had a concubine, Respha, the daughter of Jol; and Jebosthe the son of Saul said to Abenner, Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?
8. And Abenner was very angry with Jebosthe for this saying; and Abenner said to him, Am I a dog's head? I have this day wrought kindness with the house of Saul your father, and with his brethren and friends, and have not gone over to the house of David, and do you this day seek a charge against me concerning injury to a woman?
9. God do thus and more also to Abenner, if as the Lord swore to David, so do I not to him this day;
10. to take away the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to raise up the throne of David over Israel and over Juda from Dan to Bersabee.
11. And Jebosthe could not any longer answer Abenner a word, because he feared him.
12. And Abenner sent messengers to David to Thaelam where he was, immediately, saying, Make your covenant with me, and, behold, my hand is with you to bring back to you all the house of Israel.
13. And David said, With a good will I will make with you a covenant: only I demand one condition of you, saying, You shall not see my face, unless you bring Melchol the daughter of Saul, when you come to see my face.
14. And David sent messengers to Jebosthe the son of Saul, saying, Restore me my wife Melchol, whom I took for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
15. And Jebosthe sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Selle.
16. And her husband went with her weeping behind her as far as Barakim. And Abenner said to him, Go, return; and he returned.
17. And Abenner spoke to the elders of Israel, saying, In former days you° sought David to reign over you;
18. and now perform it: for the Lord has spoken concerning David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save Israel out of the hand of all their enemies.
19. And Abenner spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abenner went to speak in the ears of David at Chebron, all that seemed good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of the house of Benjamin.
20. And Abenner came to David to Chebron, and with him twenty men: and David made for Abenner and his men with him a banquet of wine.
21. And Abenner said to David, I will arise now, and go, and gather to my lord the king all Israel; and I will make with him a covenant, and you shall reign over all whom your soul desires. And David sent away Abenner, and he departed in peace.
22. And, behold, the servants of David and Joab arrived from their expedition, and they brought much spoil with them: and Abenner was not with David in Chebron, because he had sent him away, and he had departed in peace.
23. And Joab and all his army came, and it was reported to Joab, saying, Abenner the son of Ner is come to David, and David has let him go, and he has departed in peace.
24. And Joab went in to the king, and said, What is this that you have done? behold, Abenner came to you; and why have you let him go, and he has departed in peace?
25. Know you not the mischief of Abenner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all things that you do?
26. And Joab returned from David, and sent messengers to Abenner after him; and they bring him back from the well of Seiram: but David knew it not.
27. And he brought back Abenner to Chebron, and Joab caused him to turn aside from the gate to speak to him, laying wait for him: and he struck him there in the loins, and he died for the blood of Asael the brother of Joab.
28. And David heard of it afterwards, and said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the Lord even for ever of the blood of Abenner the son of Ner.
29. Let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all the house of his father; and let there not be lacking of the house of Joab one that has an issue, or a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls by the sword, or that wants bread.
30. For Joab and Abessa his brother laid wait continually for Abenner, because he killed Asael their brother at Gabaon in the battle.
31. And David said to Joab and to all the people with him, Rend your garments, and gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament before Abenner. And king David followed the bier.
32. And they bury Abenner in Chebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at his tomb, and all the people wept for Abenner.
33. And the king mourned over Abenner, and said, Shall Abenner die according to the death of Nabal?
34. Your hands were not bound, and your feet were not put in fetters: one brought you not near as Nabal; you did fall before children of iniquity.
35. And all the people assembled to weep for him. And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day: and David swore, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if I eat bread or any thing else before the sun goes down.
36. And all the people took notice, and all things that the king did before the people were pleasing in their sight.
37. So all the people and all Israel perceived in that day, that it was not of the king to kill Abenner the son of Ner.
38. And the king said to his servants, Know you° not that a great prince is this day fallen in Israel?
39. And that I am this day a mere kinsman of his, and as it were a subject; but these men the sons of Saruia are too hard for me: the Lord reward the evil-doer according to his wickedness.

1. And Jebosthe the son of Saul heard that Abenner the son of Ner had died in Chebron; and his hands were paralyzed, and all the men of Israel grew faint.
2. And Jebosthe the son of Saul had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baana, and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Remmon the Berothite of the children of Benjamin; for Beroth was reckoned to the children of Benjamin.
3. And the Berothites ran away to Gethaim, and were sojourners there until this day.
4. And Jonathan Saul's son had a son lame of his feet, five years old, and he was in the way when the news of Saul and Jonathan his son came from Jezrael, and his nurse took him up, and fled; and it came to pass as he hasted and retreated, that he fell, and was lamed. And his name was Memphibosthe.
5. And Rechab and Baana the sons of Remmon the Berothite went, and they came in the heat of the day into the house of Jebosthe; and he was sleeping on a bed at noon.
6. And, behold, the porter of the house winnowed wheat, and he slumbered and slept: and the brothers Rechab and Baana went privily into the house:
7. And Jebosthe was sleeping on his bed in his chamber: and they strike him, and kill him, and take off his head: and they took his head, and went all the night by the western road.
8. And they brought the head of Jebosthe to David to Chebron, and they said to the king, Behold the head of Jebosthe the son of Saul your enemy, who sought your life; and the Lord has executed for my lord the king vengeance on his enemies, as it is this day: even on Saul your enemy, and on his seed.
9. And David answered and Rechab and Baana his brother, the sons of Remmon the Berothite, and said to them, As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all affliction;
10. he that reported to me that Saul was dead, even he was as one bringing glad tidings before me: but I seized him and killed him in Sekelac, to whom I ought, as he thought, to have given a reward for his tidings.
11. And now evil men have slain a righteous men in his house on his bed: now then I will require his blood of your hand, and I will destroy you from off the earth.
12. And David commanded his young men, and they kill them, and cut off their hands and their feet; and they hung them up at the fountain in Chebron: and they buried the head of Jebosthe in the tomb of Abenezer the son of Ner.

1. And all the tribes of Israel come to David to Chebron, and they said to him, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
2. And heretofore Saul being king over us, you was he that did lead out and bring in Israel: and the Lord said to you, You shall feed my people Israel, and you shall be for a leader to my people Israel.
3. And all the elders of Israel come to the king to Chebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Chebron before the Lord; and they anoint David king over all Israel.
4. David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
5. Seven years and six months he reigned in Chebron over Juda, and thirty-three years he reigned over all Israel and Juda in Jerusalem.
6. And David and his men, departed to Jerusalem, to the Jebusite that inhabited the land: and it was said to David, You shall not come in hither: for the blind and the lame withstood him, saying, David shall not come in hither.
7. And David took first the hold of Sion: this is the city of David.
8. And David said on that day, Every one that smites the Jebusite, let him attack with the dagger both the lame and the blind, and those that hate the soul of David. Therefore they say, The lame and the blind shall not enter into the house of the Lord.
9. And David lived in the hold, and it was called the city of David, and he built the city itself round about from the citadel, and he built his own house.
10. And David advanced and became great, and the Lord Almighty was with him.
11. And Chiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar wood, and carpenters, and stone-masons: and they built a house for David.
12. And David knew that the Lord had prepared him to be king over Israel, and that his kingdom was exalted for the sake of his people Israel.
13. And David took again wives and concubines out of Jerusalem, after he came from Chebron: and David had still more sons and daughters born to him.
14. And these are the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem; Sammus, and Sobab, and Nathan, and Solomon.
15. And Ebear, and Elisue, and Naphec, and Jephies.
16. And Elisama, and Elidae, and Eliphalath, Samae, Jessibath, Nathan, Galamaan, Jebaar, Theesus, Eliphalat, Naged, Naphec, Janathan, Leasamys, Baalimath, Eliphaath.
17. And the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over Israel; and all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the strong hold.
18. And the Philistines came, and assembled in the valley of the giants.
19. And David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and will you deliver them into my hands? and the Lord said to David, Go up, for I will surely deliver the Philistines into your hands.
20. And David came from Upper Breaches, and struck the Philistines there: and David said, The Lord has destroyed the hostile Philistines before me, as water is dispersed; therefore the name of that place was called Over Breaches.
21. And they leave there their gods, and David and his men with him took them.
22. And the Philistines came up yet again, and assembled in the valley of Giants.
23. And David enquired of the Lord: and the Lord said, You shall not go up to meet them: turn from them, and you shall meet them near the place of weeping.
24. And it shall come to pass when you hear the sound of a clashing together from the grove of weeping, then you shall go down to them, for then the Lord shall go forth before you to make havoc in the battle with the Philistines.
25. And David did as the Lord commanded him, and struck the Philistines from Gabaon as far as the land of Gazera.
** 6
1. And David again gathered all the young men of Israel, about seventy thousand.
2. And David arose, and went, he and all the people that were with him, and some of the rulers of Juda, on an expedition to a distant place, to bring back thence the ark of God, on which the name of the Lord of Host who dwells between the cherubs upon it is called.
3. And they put the ark of the Lord on a new waggon, and took it out of the house of Aminadab who lived on the hill, and Oza and his brethren the sons of Aminadab drove the waggon with the ark.
4. And his brethren went before the ark.
5. And David and the children of Israel were playing before the Lord on well-tuned instruments mightily, and with songs, and with harps, and with lutes, and with drums, and with cymbals, and with pipes.
6. And they come as far as the threshing floor of Nachor: and Oza reached forth his hand to the ark of God to keep it steady, and took hold of it; for the ox shook it out of its place.
7. And the Lord was very angry with Oza; and God struck him there: and he died there by the ark of the Lord before God.
8. And David was dispirited because the Lord made a breach upon Oza; and that place was called the breach of Oza until this day.
9. And David feared the Lord in that day, saying, How shall the ark of the Lord come in to me?
10. And David would not bring in the ark of the covenant of the Lord to himself into the city of David: and David turned it aside into the house of Abeddara the Gethite.
11. And the ark of the Lord lodged in the house of Abeddara the Gethite three months, and the Lord blessed all the house of Abeddara, and all his possessions.
12. And it was reported to king David, saying, The Lord has blessed the house of Abeddara, and all that he has, because of the ark of the Lord. And David went, and brought up the Ark of the Lord from the house of Abeddara to the city of David with gladness.
13. And there were with him bearing the ark seven bands, and for a sacrifice a calf and lambs.
14. And David sounded with well-tuned instruments before the Lord, and David was clothed with a fine long robe.
15. And David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of a trumpet.
16. And it came to pass as the ark arrived at the city of David, that Melchol the daughter of Saul looked through the window, and saw king David dancing and playing before the Lord; and she despised him in her heart.
17. And they bring the ark of the Lord, and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle which David pitched for it: and David offered whole burnt offerings before the Lord, and peace-offerings.
18. And David made an end of offering the whole burnt offerings and peace-offerings, and blessed the people in the name of the Lord of Hosts.
19. And he distributed to all the people, even to all the host of Israel from Dan to Bersabee, both men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a joint of meat, and a cake from the frying-pan: and all the people departed every one to his home.
20. And David returned to bless his house. And Melchol the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and saluted him, and said, How was the king of Israel glorified today, who was today uncovered in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the dancers wantonly uncovers himself!
21. And David said to Melchol, I will dance before the Lord. Blessed be the Lord who chose me before your father, and before all his house, to make me head over his people, even over Israel: therefore I will play, and dance before the Lord.
22. And I will again uncover myself thus, and I will be vile in your eyes, and with the maidservants by whom you said that I was not had in honor.
23. And Melchol the daughter of Saul had no child till the day of her death.

1. And it came to pass when the king sat in his house, and the Lord had given him an inheritance on every side free from all his enemies round about him;
2. that the king said to Nathan the prophet, Behold now, I live in a house of cedar, and the ark of the Lord dwells in the midst of a tent.
3. And Nathan said to the king, Go and do all that is in your heart, for the Lord is with you.
4. And it came to pass in that night, that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying,
5. Go, and say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord, You shall not build me a house for me to dwell in.
6. For I have not lived in a house from the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt to this day, but I have been walking in a lodge and in a tent,
7. wherever I went with all Israel. Have I ever spoken to any of the tribes of Israel, which I commanded to tend my people Israel, saying, Why have you° not built me a house of Cedar?
8. And now thus shall you say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord Almighty, I took you from the sheep-cote, that you should be a prince over my people, over Israel.
9. And I was with you wherever you went, and I destroyed all your enemies before you, and I made you renowned according to the renown of the great ones on the earth.
10. And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell by themselves, and shall be no more distressed; and the son of iniquity shall no more afflict them, as he has done from the beginning,
11. from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel: and I will give you rest from all your enemies, and the Lord will tell you that you shall build a house to him.
12. And it shall come to pass when your days shall have been fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, that I will raise up your seed after you, even your own issue, and I will establish his kingdom.
13. He shall build for me a house to my name, and I will set up his throne even for ever.
14. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. And when he happens to transgress, then will I chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men.
15. But my mercy I will not take from him, as I took it from those whom I removed from my presence.
16. And his house shall be made sure, and his kingdom for ever before me, and his throne shall be set up for ever.
17. According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
18. And king David came in, and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord, my Lord, and what is my house, that you have loved me hitherto?
19. Whereas I was very little before you, O Lord, my Lord, yet you spoke concerning the house of your servant for a long time to to come. And is this the law of man, O Lord, my Lord?
20. And what shall David yet say to you? and now you know your servant, O Lord, my Lord.
21. And you have wrought for your servant's sake, and according to your heart you have wrought all this greatness, to make it known to your servant,
22. that he may magnify you, O my Lord; for there is no one like you, and there is no God, but you among all of whom we have heard with our ears.
23. And what other nation in the earth is as your people Israel? whereas God was his guide, to redeem for himself a people to make you a name, to do mightily and nobly, so that you should cast out nations an their tabernacles from the presence of your people, whom you did redeem for yourself out of Egypt?
24. And you have prepared for yourself your people Israel to be a people for ever, and you, Lord, are become their God.
25. And now, O my Lord, the Almighty Lord God of Israel, confirm the word for ever which you have spoken concerning your servant and his house: and now as you have said,
26. Let your name be magnified for ever.
27. Almighty Lord God of Israel, you have uncovered the ear of your servant, saying, I will build you a house: therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to you.
28. And now, O Lord my Lord, you are God; and your words will be true, and you have spoken these good things concerning your servant.
29. And now begin and bless the house of your servant, that it may continue for ever before you; for you, O Lord, my Lord, have spoken, and the house of your servant shall be blessed with your blessing so as to continue for ever.

1. And it came to pass after this, that David struck the Philistines, and put them to flight, and David took the tribute from out of the hand of the Philistines.
2. And David struck Moab, and measured them out with lines, having laid them down on the ground: and there were two lines for slaying, and two lines he kept alive: and Moab became servants to David, yielding tribute.
3. And David struck Adraazar the son of Raab king of Suba, as he went to extend his power to the river Euphrates.

7. And David took the golden bracelets which were on the servants of Adraazar king of Suba, and brought them to Jerusalem. And Susakim king of Egypt took them, when he went up to Jerusalem in the days of Roboam son of Solomon.
8. And king David took from Metebac, and from the choice cities of Adraazar, very much brass: with that Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the lavers, and all the furniture.
9. And You the king of Hemath heard that David had struck all the host of Adraazar.
10. And You sent Jedduram his son to king David, to ask him of his welfare, and to congratulate him on his fighting against Adraazar and striking him, for he was an enemy to Adraazar: and in his hands were vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass.
11. And these king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and with the gold which he consecrated out of all the cities which he conquered,
12. out of Idumea, and out of Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalec, and from the spoils of Adraazar son of Raab king of Suba.
13. And David made himself a name: and when he returned he struck Idumea in Gebelem to the number of eighteen thousand.
14. And he set garrisons in Idumea, even in all Idumea: and all the Idumeans were servants to the king. And the Lord preserved David wherever he went.
15. And David reigned over all Israel: and David wrought judgment and justice over all his people.
16. And Joab the son of Saruia was over the host; and Josaphat the son of Achilud was keeper of the records.
17. And Sadoc the son of Achitob, and Achimelech son of Abiathar, were priests; and Sasa was the scribe,
18. and Banaeas son of Jodae was councillor, and the Chelethite and the Phelethite, and the sons of David, were princes of the court.

1. And David said, Is there yet any one left in the house of Saul, that I may deal kindly with him for Jonathan's sake?
2. And there was a servant of the house of Saul, and his name was Siba: and they call him to David; and the king said to him, Are you Siba? and he said, I am your servant.
3. And the king said, Is there yet a man left of the house of Saul, that I may act towards him with the mercy of God? and Siba said to the king, There is yet a son of Jonathan, lame of his feet.
4. And the king said, Where is he? and Siba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Amiel of Lodabar.
5. And king David went, and took him out of the house of Machir the son Amiel of Lodabar.
6. And Memphibosthe the son of Jonathan the son of Saul comes to the king David, and he fell upon his face and did obeisance to him: and David said to him, Memphibosthe: and he said, Behold your servant.
7. And David said to him, Fear not, for I will surely deal mercifully with you for the sake of Jonathan your father, and I will restore to you all the land of Saul the father of your father; and you shall eat bread at my table continually.
8. And Memphibosthe did obeisance, and said, Who am I your servant, that you have looked upon a dead dog like me?
9. And the king called Siba the servant of Saul, and said to him, All that belonged to Saul and to all his house have I given to the son of your lord.
10. And you, and your sons, and your servants, shall till the land for him; and you shall bring in bread to the son of your lord, and he shall eat bread: and Memphibosthe the son of your lord shall eat bread continually at my table. Now Siba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
11. And Siba said to the king, According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant, so will your servant do. And Memphibosthe did eat at the table of David, as one of the sons of the king.
12. And Memphibosthe had a little son, and his name was Micha: and all the household of Siba were servants to Memphibosthe.
13. And Memphibosthe lived in Jerusalem, for he continually ate at the table of the king; and he was lame in both his feet.
** 10
1. And it came to pass after this that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Annon his son reigned in his stead.
2. And David said, I will show mercy to Annon the son of Naas, as his father dealt mercifully with me. And David sent to comfort him concerning his father by the hand of his servants; and the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon.
3. And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Annon their lord, Is it to honor your father before you that David has sent comforters to you? Has not David rather sent his servants to you that they should search the city, and spy it out and examine it?
4. And Annon took the servants of David, and shaved their beards, and cut off their garments in the midst as far as their haunches, and sent them away.
5. And they brought David word concerning the men; and he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly dishonored: and the king said, Remain in Jericho till your beards have grown, and then you° shall return.
6. And the children of Ammon saw that the people of David were ashamed; and the children of Ammon sent, and hired the Syrians of Baethraam, and the Syrians of Suba, and Roob, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Amalec with a thousand men, and Istob with twelve thousand men.
7. And David heard, and sent Joab and all his host, even the mighty men.
8. And the children of Ammon went forth, and set the battle in array by the door of the gate: those of Syria, Suba, and Roob, and Istob, and Amalec, being by themselves in the field.
9. And Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him from that which was opposed in front and from behind, and he chose out some of all the young men of Israel, and they set themselves in array against Syria.
10. And the rest of the people he gave into the hand of Abessa his brother, and they set the battle in array opposite to the children of Ammon.
11. And he said, If Syria be too strong for me, then shall you° help me: and if the children of Ammon be too strong for you, then will we be ready to help you.
12. Be you courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the sake of the cities of our God, and the Lord shall do that which is good in his eyes.
13. And Joab and his people with him advanced to battle against Syria, and they fled from before him.
14. And the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, and they fled from before Abessa, and entered into the city: and Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
15. And the Syrians saw that they were worsted before Israel, and they gathered themselves together.
16. And Adraazar sent and gathered the Syrians from the other side of the river Chalamak, and they came to Aelam; and Sobac the captain of the host of Adraazar was at their head.
17. And it was reported to David, and he gathered all Israel, and went over Jordan, and came to Aelam: and the Syrians set the battle in array against David, and fought with him.
18. And Syria fled from before Israel, and David destroyed of Syria seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and he struck Sobac the captain of his host, and he died there.
19. And all the kings the servants of Adraazar saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, and they went over to Israel, and served them: and Syria was afraid to help the children of Ammon any more.
** 11
1. And it came to pass when the time o the year for kings going out to battle had come round, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbath: but David remained at Jerusalem.
2. And it came to pass toward evening, that David arose off his couch, and walked on the roof of the king's house, and saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
3. And David sent and enquired about the woman: and one said, Is not this Bersabee the daughter of Eliab, the wife of Urias the Chettite?
4. And David sent messengers, and took her, and went in to her, and he lay with her: and she was purified from her uncleanness, and returned to her house.
5. And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
6. And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Urias the Chettite; and Joab sent Urias to David.
7. And Urias arrived and went in to him, and David asked him how Joab was, and how the people were, and how the war went on.
8. And David said to Urias, Go to your house, and wash your feet: and Urias departed from the house of the king, and a portion of meat from the king followed him.
9. And Urias slept at the door of the king with the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
10. And they brought David word, saying, Urias has not gone down to his house. And David said to Urias, Are you not come from a journey? why have you not gone down to your house?
11. And Urias said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Juda dwell in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; and shall I go into my house to eat and drink, and lie with my wife? how should I do this? as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.
12. And David said to Urias, Remain here today also, and to-morrow I will let you go. So Urias remained in Jerusalem that day and the day following.
13. And David called him, and he ate before him and drank, and he made him drunk: and he went out in the evening to lie upon his bed with the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
14. And the morning came, and David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Urias.
15. And he wrote in the letter, saying, Station Urias in front of the severe part of the fight, and retreat from behind him, so shall he be wounded and die.
16. And it came to pass while Joab was watching against the city, that he set Urias in a place where he knew that valiant men were.
17. And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and some of the people of the servants of David fell, and Urias the Chettite died also.
18. And Joab sent, and reported to David all the events of the war, so as to tell them to the king.
19. And he charged the messenger, saying, When you have finished reporting all the events of the war to the king,
20. then it shall come to pass if the anger of the king shall arise, and he shall say to you, Why did you° draw near to the city to fight? knew you° not that they would shoot from off the wall?
21. Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerobaal son of Ner? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from above the wall, and he died in Thamasi? why did you° draw near to the wall? then you shall say, Your servant Urias the Chettite is also dead.
22. And the messenger of Joab went to the king to Jerusalem, and he came and reported to David all that Joab told him, all the affairs of the war. And David was very angry with Joab, and said to the messenger, Why did you° draw near to the wall to fight? knew you° not that you° would be wounded from off the wall? Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerobaal? did not a woman cast upon him a piece of millstone from the wall, and he died in Thamasi? why did you° draw near to the wall?
23. And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and they came out against us into the field, and we came upon them even to the door of the gate.
24. And the archers shot at your servants from off the wall, and some of the king's servants died, and your servant Urias the Chettite is dead also.
25. And David said to the messenger, Thus shall you say to Joab, Let not the matter be grievous in your eyes, for the sword devours one way at one time and another way at another: strengthen your array against the city, and destroy it, and strengthen him.
26. And the wife of Urias heard that Urias her husband was dead, and she mourned for her husband.
27. And the time of mourning expired, and David sent and took her into his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son: but the thing which David did was evil in the eyes of the Lord.
** 12
1. And the Lord sent Nathan the prophet to David; and he went in to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city, one rich and the other poor.
2. And the rich man had very many flocks and herds.
3. But the poor man had only one little ewe lamb, which he had purchased, and preserved, and reared; an it grew up with himself and his children in common; it ate of his bread and drank of his cup, and slept in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.
4. And a traveller came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his flocks and of his herds, to dress for the traveller that came to him; and he took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that came to him.
5. And David was greatly moved with anger against the man; and David said to Nathan, As the Lord lives, the man that did this thing shall surely die.
6. And he shall restore the lamb sevenfold, because he has not spared.
7. And Nathan said to David, You are the man that has done this. Thus says the Lord God of Israel, I anointed you to be king over Israel, and I rescued you out the hand of Saul;
8. and I gave you the house of your lord, and the wives of your lord into your bosom, and I gave to you the house of Israel and Juda; and if that had been little, I would have given you yet more.
9. Why have you set at nothing the word of the Lord, to do that which is evil in his eyes? you have slain Urias the Chettite with the sword, and you have taken his wife to be your wife, and you have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
10. Now therefore the sword shall not depart from your house for ever, because you have set me at nothing, and you have taken the wife of Urias the Chettite, to be your wife.
11. Thus says the Lord, Behold, I will raise up against you evil out of your house, and I will take your wives before your eyes, and will give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.
12. For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing in the sight of all Israel, and before the sun.
13. And David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord. And Nathan said to David, And the Lord has put away your sin; you shall not die.
14. Only because you have given great occasion of provocation to the enemies of the Lord by this thing, your son also that is born to you shall surely die.
15. And Nathan departed to his house. And the Lord struck the child, which the wife of Urias the Chettite bore to David, and it was ill.
16. And David enquired of God concerning the child, and David fasted, and went in and lay all night upon the ground.
17. And the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the ground, but he would not rise, nor did he eat bread with them.
18. And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died: and the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive we spoke to him, and he listened not to our voice; and you should we tell him that the child is dead?—so would he do himself harm.
19. And David understood that his servants were whispering, and David perceived that the child was dead: and David said to his servants, Is the child dead? and they said, He is dead.
20. Then David rose up from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his raiment, and went into the house of God, and worshipped him; and went into his own house, and called for bread to eat, and they set bread before him and he ate.
21. And his servants said to him, What is this thing that you have done concerning the child? while it was yet living you did fast, and weep, and watch: and when the child was dead you did rise up, and did eat bread, and drink.
22. And David said, While the child yet lived, I fasted and wept; for I said, Who knows if the Lord will pity me, and the child live?
23. But now it is dead, why should I fast thus? shall I be able to bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
24. And David comforted Bersabee his wife, and he went in to her, and lay with her; and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his named Solomon, and the Lord loved him.
25. And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and called his name Jeddedi, for the Lord's sake.
26. And Joab fought against Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.
27. And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbath, and taken the city of waters.
28. And now gather the rest of the people, and encamp against the city, an take it beforehand; lest I take the city first, and my name be called upon it.
29. And David gathered all the people, and went to Rabbath, and fought against it, and took it.
30. And he took the crown of Molchom their king from off his head, and the weight of it was a talent of gold, with precious stones, and it was upon the head of David; and he carried forth very much spoil of the city.
31. And he brought forth the people that were in it, and put them under the saw, and under iron harrows, and axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus he did to all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
** 13
1. And it happened after this that Abessalom the son of David had a very beautiful sister, and her name was Themar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.
2. And Amnon was distressed even to sickness, because of Themar his sister; for she was a virgin, and it seemed very difficult for Amnon to do anything to her.
3. And Amnon had a friend, and his name was Jonadab, the son of Samaa the brother of David: and Jonadab was a very cunning man.
4. And he said to him, What ails you that you are thus weak? O son of the king, morning by morning? will you not tell me? and Ammon said, I love Themar the sister of my brother Abessalom.
5. And Jonadab said to him, Lie upon your bed, and make yourself sick, and your father shall come in to see you; and you shall say to him, Let, I pray you, Themar my sister come, and feed me with morsels, and let her prepare food before my eyes, that I may see and eat at her hands.
6. So Ammon lay down, and made himself sick; and the king came in to see him: and Amnon said to the king, Let, I pray you, my sister Themar come to me, and make a couple of cakes in my sight, and I will eat them at her hand.
7. And David sent to Themar to the house, saying, Go now to your brother's house, and dress him food.
8. And Themar went to the house of her brother Amnon, and he was lying down: and she took the dough and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.
9. And she took the frying pan and poured them out before him, but he would not eat. And Amnon said, Send out every man from about me. And they removed every man from about him.
10. And Amnon said to Themar, Bring in the food into the closet, and I will eat of your hand. And Themar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them to her brother Amnon into the chamber.
11. And she brought them to him to eat, and he caught hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.
12. And she said to him, Nay, my brother, do not humble me, for it ought not to be so done in Israel; do not this folly.
13. And I, whither shall I remove my reproach? and you shall be as one of the fools in Israel. And now, speak, I pray you, to the king, for surely he will not keep me from you.
14. But Amnon would not listen to her voice; and he prevailed against her, and humbled her, and lay with her.
15. Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her, for the last wickedness was greater than the first: and Amnon said to her, Rise, and be gone.
16. And Themar spoke to him concerning this great mischief, greater, said she, than the other that you did me, to send me away: but Amnon would not listen to her voice.
17. And he called his servant who had charge of the house, and said to him, Put now this woman out from me, and shut the door after her.
18. And she had on her a variegated robe, for so were the king's daughters that were virgins attired in their apparel: and his servant led her forth, and shut the door after her.
19. And Themar took ashes, and put them on her head; and she tore the variegated garment that was upon her: and she laid her hands on her head, and went crying continually.
20. And Abessalom her brother said to her, Has your brother Amnon been with you? now then, my sister, be silent, for he is your brother: be not careful to mention this matter. So Themar lived as a widow in the house of her brother Abessalom.
21. And king David heard of all these things, and was very angry; but he did not grieve the spirit of his son Amnon, because be loved him, for he was his firstborn.
22. And Abessalom spoke not to Amnon, good or bad, because Abessalom hated Amnon, on account of his humbling his sister Themar.
23. And it came to pass at the end of two whole years, that they were shearing sheep for Abessalom in Belasor near Ephraim: and Abessalom invited all the king's sons.
24. And Abessalom came to the king, and said, Behold, your servant has a sheep-shearing; let now the king and his servants go with your servant.
25. And the king said to Abessalom, Nay, my son, let us not all go, and let us not be burdensome to you. And he pressed him; but he would not go, but blessed him.
26. And Abessalom said to him, And if not, let I pray you, my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said to him, Why should he go with you?
27. And Abessalom pressed him, and he sent with him Amnon and all the king's sons; and Abessalom made a banquet like the banquet of the king.
28. And Abessalom charged his servants, saying, Mark when the heart of Amnon shall be merry with wine, and I shall say to you, Strike Amnon, and kill him: fear not; for is it not I that command you? Be courageous, and be valiant.
29. And the servants of Abessalom did to Amnon as Abessalom commanded them: and all the sons of the king rose up, and they mounted every man his mule, and fled.
30. And it came to pass, when they were in the way, that a report came to David, saying, Abessalom has slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.
31. Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay upon the ground: and all his servants that were standing round him tore their garments.
32. And Jonadab the son of Samaa brother of David, answered and said, Let not my Lord the king say that he has slain all the young men the sons of the king, for Amnon only of them all is dead; for he was appointed to death by the mouth of Abessalom from the day that he humbled his sister Themar.
33. And now let not my lord the king take the matter to heart, saying, All the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only of them is dead.
34. And Abessalom escaped: and the young man the watchman, lifted up his eyes, and looked; and, behold, much people went in the way behind him from the side of the mountain in the descent: and the watchman came and told the king, and said, I have seen men by the way of Oronen, by the side of the mountain.
35. And Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king's sons are present: according to the word of your servant, so has it happened.
36. And it came to pass when he had finished speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voices and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept with a very great weeping.
37. But Abessalom fled, and went to Tholmi son of Emiud the king of Gedsur to the land of Chamaachad: and king David mourned for his son continually.
38. So Abessalom fled, and departed to Gedsur, and was there three years.
39. And king David ceased to go out after Abessalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon, touching his death.
** 14
1. And Joab the son of Saruia knew that the heart of the king was toward Abessalom.
2. And Joab sent to Thecoe, and took thence a cunning woman, and said to her, Mourn, I pray you, and put on mourning apparel, and anoint you not with oil, and you shall be as a woman mourning for one that is dead thus for many days.
3. And you shall go to the king, and speak to him according to this word. And Joab put the words in her mouth.
4. So the woman of Thecoe went in to the king and fell upon her face to the earth, and did him obeisance, and said, Help, O king, help.
5. And the king said to her, What is the matter with you? And she said, I am indeed a widow woman, and my husband is dead.
6. And moreover your handmaid had two sons, and they fought together in the field, and there was no one to part them; and the one struck the other his brother, and killed him.
7. And behold the whole family rose up against your handmaid, and they said, Give up the one that struck his brother, and we will put him to death for the life of his brother, whom he killed, and we will take away even your heir: so they will quench my coal that is left, so as not to leave my husband remnant or name on the face of the earth.
8. And the king said to the woman, Go in peace to your house, and I will give commandment concerning you.
9. And the woman of Thecoe said to the king, On me, my lord, O king, and on my father's house be the iniquity, and the king and his throne be guiltless.
10. And the king said, Who was it that spoke to you? you shall even bring him to me, and one shall not touch him any more.
11. And she said, Let now the king remember concerning his Lord God in that the avenger of blood is multiplied to destroy, and let them not take away my son. And he said, As the lord lives, not a hair of your son shall fall to the ground.
12. And the woman said, Let now your servant speak a word to my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
13. And the woman said, Why have you devised this thing against the people of God? or is this word out of the king's mouth as a transgression, so that the king should not bring back his banished?
14. For we shall surely die, and be as water poured upon the earth, which shall not be gathered up, and God shall take the life, even as he devises to thrust forth from him his outcast.
15. And now whereas I came to speak this word to my lord the king, the reason is that the people will see me, and your handmaid will say, Let one now speak to my lord the king, if perhaps the king will perform the request of his handmaid;
16. for the king will hear. Let him rescue his handmaid out of the hand of the man that seeks to cast out me and my son from the inheritance of God.
17. And the woman said, If now the word of my lord the king be gracious, —well: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king, to hear good and evil: and the Lord your God shall be with you.
18. And the king answered, and said to the woman, Hide not from me, I pray you, the matter which I ask you. And the woman said, Let my lord the king by all means speak.
19. And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab in all this matter with you? and the woman said to the king, As your soul lives, my lord, O king, there is no turning to the right hand or to the left from all that my lord the king has spoken; for your servant Joab himself charged me, and he put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid.
20. In order that this form of speech might come about it was that your servant Joab has framed this matter: and my lord is wise as is the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.
21. And the king said to Joab, Behold now, I have done to you according to this your word: go, bring back the young man Abessalom.
22. And Joab fell on his face to the ground, and did obeisance, and blessed the king: and Joab said, To-day your servant knows that I have found grace in your sight, my lord, O king, for my lord the king has performed the request of his servant.
23. And Joab arose, and went to Gedsur, and brought Abessalom to Jerusalem.
24. And the king said, Let him return to his house, and not see my face. And Abessalom returned to his house, and saw not the king's face.
25. And there was not a man in Israel so very comely as Abessalom: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
26. And when he polled his head, (and it was at the beginning of every year that he polled it, because it grew, heavy upon him,) even when he polled it, he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels according to the royal shekel.
27. And there were born to Abessalom three sons and one daughter, and her name was Themar: she was a very beautiful woman, and she becomes the wife of Roboam son of Solomon, and she bears to him Abia.
28. And Abessalom remained in Jerusalem two full years, and he saw not the king's face.
29. And Abessalom sent to Joab to bring him in to the king, and he would not come to him: and he sent to him the second time, and he would not come.
30. And Abessalom said to his servants, Behold, Joab's portion in the field is next to mine, and he has in it barley; go and set it on fire. And the servants of Abessalom set the field on fire: and the servants of Joab come to him with their clothes tore, and they said to him, The servants of Abessalom have set the field on fire.
31. And Joab arose, and came to Abessalom into the house, and said to him, Why have your servants set my field on fire?
32. And Abessalom said to Joab, Behold, I sent to you, saying, Come hither, and I will send you to the king, saying, Why did I come out of Gedsur? it would have been better for me to have remained there: and now, behold, I have not seen the face of the king; but if there is iniquity in me, then put me to death.
33. And Joab went in to the king, and brought him word: and he called Abessalom, and he went in to the king, and did him obeisance, and fell upon his face to the ground, even in the presence of the king; and the king kissed Abessalom.
** 15
1. And it came to pass after this that Abessalom prepared for himself chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
2. And Abessalom rose early, and stood by the side of the way of the gate: and it came to pass that every man who had a cause, came to the king for judgment, and Abessalom cried to him, and said to him, Of what city are you? And he said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.
3. And Abessalom said to him, See, your affairs are right and clear, yet you have no one appointed of the king to hear you.
4. And Abessalom said, O that one would make me a judge in the land; then every man who had a dispute or a cause would come to me, and I would judge him!
5. And it came to pass when a man came near to do him obeisance, that he stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.
6. And Abessalom did after this manner to all Israel that came to the king for judgment; and Abessalom gained the hearts of the men of Israel.
7. And it came to pass after forty years, that Abessalom said to his father, I will go now, and pay my vows, which I vowed to the Lord in Chebron.
8. For your servant vowed a vow when I lived at Gedsur in Syria, saying, If the Lord should indeed restore me to Jerusalem, then will I serve the Lord.
9. And the king said to him, Go in peace. And he arose and went to Chebron.
10. And Abessalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, When you° hear the sound of the trumpet, then shall you° say, Abessalom is become king in Chebron.
11. And there went with Abessalom two hundred chosen men from Jerusalem; and they went in their simplicity, and knew not anything.
12. And Abessalom sent to Achitophel the Theconite, the counsellor of David, from his city, from Gola, where he was sacrificing: and there was a strong conspiracy; and the people with Abessalom were increasingly numerous.
13. And there came a messenger to David, saying, the heart of the men of Israel is gone after Abessalom.
14. And David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, Rise, and let us flee, for we have no refuge from Abessalom: make haste and go, lest he overtake us speedily, and bring evil upon us, and strike the city with the edge of the sword.
15. And the king's servants said to the king, In all things which our lord the king chooses, behold we are your servants.
16. And the king and all his house went out on foot: and the king left ten women of his concubines to keep the house.
17. And the king and all his servants went out on foot; and abode in a distant house.
18. And all his servants passed on by his side, and every Chelethite, and every Phelethite, and they stood by the olive tree in the wilderness: and all the people marched near him, and all his court, and all the men of might, and all the men of war, six hundred: and they were present at his side: and every Chelethite, and every Phelethite, and all the six hundred Gittites that came on foot out of Geth, and they went on before the king.
19. And the king said to Ethi, the Gittite, Why do you also go with us? return, and dwell with the king, for you are a stranger, and you have come forth as a sojourner out of your place.
20. Whereas you came yesterday, shall I today cause you to travel with us, and shall you thus change your place? you did come forth yesterday, and today shall I set you in motion to go along with us? I indeed will go wherever I may go: return then, and cause your brethren to return with you, and may the Lord deal mercifully and truly with you.
21. And Ethi answered the king and said, As the Lord lives and as my lord the king lives, in the place wherever my lord shall be, whether it be for death or life, there shall your servant be.
22. And the king said to Ethi, Come and pass over with me. So Ethi the Gittite and the king passed over, and all his servants, and all the multitude with him.
23. And all the country wept with a loud voice. And all the people passed by over the brook of Kedron; and the king crossed the brook Kedron: and all the people and the king passed on toward the way of the wilderness.
24. And behold also Sadoc, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Baethar: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had passed out of the city.
25. And the king said to Sadoc, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I should find favor in the eyes of the Lord, then will he bring me back, and he will show me it and its beauty.
26. But if he should say thus, I have no pleasure in you; behold, here I am, let him do to me according to that which is good in his eyes.
27. And the king said to Sadoc the priest, Behold, you shall return to the city in peace, and Achimaas your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons with you.
28. Behold, I continue in arms in Araboth of the desert, until there come tidings from you to report to me.
29. So Sadoc and Abiathar brought back the ark of the Lord to Jerusalem, and it continued there.
30. And David went up by the ascent of the mount of Olives, ascending and weeping, and had his head covered, and went barefooted: and all the people that were with him covered every man his head; and they went up, ascending and weeping.
31. And it was reported to David, saying, Achitophel also is among the conspirators with Abessalom. And David said, O Lord my God, disconcert, I pray you, the counsel of Achitophel.
32. And David came as far as Ros, where he worshipped God: and behold, Chusi the chief friend of David came out to meet him, having tore his garment, and earth was upon his head.
33. And David said to him, If you should go over with me, then will you be a burden to me;
34. but if you shall return to the city, and shall say to Abessalom, Your brethren are passed over, and the king your father is passed over after me: and now I am your servant, O king, suffer me to live: at one time even of late I was the servant of your father, and now I am your humble servant—so shall you disconcert for me, the counsel of Achitophel.
35. And, behold, there are there with you Sadoc and Abiathar the priests; and it shall be that every word that you shall hear of the house of the king, you shall report it to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests.
36. Behold, there are there with them their two sons, Achimaas the son of Sadoc, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar; and by them you° shall report to me every word which you° shall hear.
37. So Chusi the friend of David went into the city, and Abessalom was lately gone into Jerusalem.
** 16
1. And David passed on a little way from Ros; and, behold, Siba the servant of Memphibosthe came to meet him; and he had a couple of asses laden, and upon them two hundred loaves, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred cakes of dates, and bottle of wine.
2. And the king said to Siba, What meanest you by these? and Siba, said, The asses are for the household of the king to sit upon, and the loaves and the dates are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for them that are faint in the wilderness to drink.
3. And the king said, And where is the son of your master? and Siba said to the king, Behold, he remains in Jerusalem; for he said, To-day shall the house of Israel restore to me the kingdom of my father.
4. And the king said to Siba, Behold, all Memphibosthe's property is your. And Siba did obeisance and said, My lord, O king, let me find grace in your eyes.
5. And king David came to Baurim; and, behold, there came out from thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, and his name was Semei the son of Gera. He came forth and cursed as he went,
6. and cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on the right and left hand of the king.
7. And thus Semei said when he cursed him, Go out, go out, you bloody man, and man of sin.
8. The Lord has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, because you have reigned in his stead; and the Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of Abessalom your son: and, behold, you are taken in your mischief, because you are a bloody man.
9. And Abessa the son of Saruia said to the king, Why does this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over now and take off his head.
10. And the king said, What have I to do with you, you° sons of Saruia? even let him alone, and so let him curse, for the Lord has told him to curse David: and who shall say, Why have you done thus?
11. And David said to Abessa and to all his servants, Behold, my son who came forth out of my bowels seeks my life; still more now may the son of Benjamin: let him curse, because the Lord has told him.
12. If by any means the Lord may look on my affliction, thus shall he return me good for his cursing this day.
13. And David and all the men with him went on the way: and Semei went by the side of the hill next to him, cursing as he went, and casting stones at him, and sprinkling him with dirt.
14. And the king, and all the people with him, came away and refreshed themselves there.
15. And Abessalom and all the men of Israel went into Jerusalem, and Achitophel with him.
16. And it came to pass when Chusi the chief friend of David came to Abessalom, that Chusi said to Abessalom, Let the king live.
17. And Abessalom said to Chusi, Is this your kindness to your friend? why went you not forth with your friend?
18. And Chusi said to Abessalom, Nay, but following whom the Lord, and this people, and all Israel have chosen, —his will I be, and with him I will dwell.
19. And again, whom shall I serve? should I not in the presence of his son? As I served in the sight of your father, so will I be in your presence.
20. And Abessalom said to Achitophel, Deliberate among yourselves concerning what we should do.
21. And Achitophel said to Abessalom, Go in to your father's concubines, whom he left to keep his house; and all Israel shall hear that you have dishonored your father; and the hands of all that are with you shall be strengthened.
22. And they pitched a tent for Abessalom on the roof, and Abessalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
23. And the counsel of Achitophel, which he counselled in former days, was as if one should enquire of the word of God: so was all the counsel of Achitophel both to David and also to Abessalom.
** 17
1. And Achitophel said to Abessalom, Let me now choose out for myself twelve thousand men, and I will arise and follow after David this night:
2. and I will come upon him when he is weary and weak-handed, and I will strike him with terror; and all the people with him shall flee, and I will strike the king only of all.
3. And I will bring back all the people to you, as a bride returns to her husband: only you seek the life of one man, and all the people shall have peace.
4. And the saying was right in the eyes of Abessalom, and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel.
5. And Abessalom said, Call now also Chusi the Arachite, and let us hear what is in his mouth, even in his also.
6. And Chusi went in to Abessalom, and Abessalom spoke to him, saying, After this manner spoke Achitophel: shall we do according to his word? but if not, do you speak.
7. And Chusi said to Abessalom, This counsel which Achitophel has counselled this one time is not good.
8. And Chusi said, You know your father and his men, that they are very mighty, and bitter in their spirit, as a bereaved bear in the field, and as a wild boar in the plain: and your father is a man of war, and will not give the people rest.
9. For, behold, he is now hidden in one of the hills or in some other place: and it shall come to pass when he falls upon them at the beginning, that some one will certainly hear, and say, There has been a slaughter among the people that follow after Abessalom.
10. Then even he that is strong, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, —it shall utterly melt: for all Israel knows that your father is mighty, and they that are with him are mighty men.
11. For thus I have surely given counsel, that all Israel be generally gathered to you from Dan even to Bersabee, as the sand that is upon the sea-shore for multitude: and that your presence go in the midst of them.
12. And we will come upon him in one of the places where we shall find him, and we will encamp against him, as the dew falls upon the earth; and we will not leave of him and of his men so much as one.
13. And if he shall have taken refuge with his army in a city, then shall all Israel take ropes to that city, and we will draw it even into the river, that there may not be left there even a stone.
14. And Abessalom, and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Chusi the Arachite is better than the counsel of Achitophel. For the Lord ordained to disconcert the good counsel of Achitophel, that the Lord might bring all evil upon Abessalom.
15. And Chusi the Arachite said to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus Achitophel counselled Abessalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.
16. And now send quickly and report to David, saying, Lodge not this night in Araboth of the wilderness: even go and make haste, lest one swallow up the king, and all the people with him.
17. And Jonathan and Achimaas stood by the well of Rogel, and a maidservant went and reported to them, and they go and tell king David; for they might not be seen to enter into the city.
18. But a young man saw them and told Abessalom: and the two went quickly, and entered into the house of a man in Baurim; and he had a well in his court, and they went down into it.
19. And a woman took a covering, and spread it over the mouth of the well, and spread out ground corn upon it to dry, and the thing was not known.
20. And the servants of Abessalom came to the woman into the house, and said, Where are Achimaas and Jonathan? and the woman said to them, They are gone a little way beyond the water. And they sought and found them not, and returned to Jerusalem.
21. And it came to pass after they were gone, that they came up out of the pit, and went on their way; and reported to king David, and said to David, Arise you° and go quickly over the water, for thus has Achitophel counselled concerning you.
22. And David rose up and all the people with him, and they passed over Jordan till the morning light; there was not one missing who did not pass over Jordan.
23. And Achitophel saw that his counsel was not followed, and he saddled his ass, and rose and departed to his house into his city; and he gave orders to his household, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.
24. And David passed over to Manaim: and Abessalom crossed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
25. And Abessalom appointed Amessai in the room of Joab over the host. And Amessai was the son of a man whose name was Jether of Jezrael: he went in to Abigaia the daughter of Naas, the sister of Saruia the mother of Joab.
26. And all Israel and Abessalom encamped in the land of Galaad.
27. And it came to pass when David came to Manaim, that Uesbi the son of Naas of Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, and Machir son of Amiel of Lodabar, and Berzelli the Galaadite of Rogellim,
28. brought ten embroidered beds, (with double coverings,) and ten caldrons, and earthenware, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and meal, and beans, and pulse,
29. and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheeses of kine: and they brought them to David and to his people with him to eat; for one said, The people is faint and hungry and thirsty in the wilderness.

1. And David numbered the people with him, and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds.
2. And David sent away the people, the third part under the hand of Joab, and the third part under the hand of Abessa the son of Saruia, the brother of Joab, and the third part under the hand of Ethi the Gittite. And David said to the people, I also will surely go out with you.
3. And they said, You shall not go out: for if we should indeed flee, they will not care for us; and if half of us should die, they will not mind us; for you are as ten thousand of us: and now it is well that you shall be to us an aid to help us in the city.
4. And the king said to them, Whatsoever shall seem good in your eyes I will do. And the king stood by the side of the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.
5. And the king commanded Joab and Abessa and Ethi, saying, Spare for my sake the young man Abessalom. And all the people heard the king charging all the commanders concerning Abessalom.
6. And all the people went out into the wood against Israel; and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim.
7. And the people of Israel fell down there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter in that day, even twenty thousand men.
8. And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the land: and the wood consumed more of the people than the sword consumed among the people in that day.
9. And Abessalom went to meet the servants of David: and Abessalom was mounted on his mule, and the mule came under the thick boughs of a great oak; and his head was entangled in the oak, and he was suspended between heaven and earth; and the mule passed on from under him.
10. And a man saw it, and reported to Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Abessalom hanging in an oak.
11. And Joab said to the man who reported it to him, And, behold, you did see him: why did you not strike him there to the ground? and I would have given you ten pieces of silver, and a girdle.
12. And the man said to Joab, Were I even to receive a thousand shekels of silver, I would not lift my hand against the king's son; for in our ears the king charged you and Abessa and Ethi, saying, Take care of the young man Abessalom for me,
13. so as to do no harm to his life: and nothing of the matter will be concealed from the king, and you will set yourself against me.
14. And Joab said, I will begin this; I will not thus remain with you. And Joab took three darts in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Abessalom, while he was yet alive in the heart of the oak.
15. And ten young men that bore Joab's armor compassed Abessalom, and struck him and killed him.
16. And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab spared the people.
17. And he took Abessalom, and cast him into a great cavern in the wood, into a deep pit, and set up over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled every man to his tent.
18. Now Abessalom while yet alive had taken and set up for himself the pillar near which he was taken, and set it up so as to have the pillar in the king's dale; for he said he had no son to keep his name in remembrance: and he called the pillar, Abessalom's hand, until this day.
19. And Achimaas the son of Sadoc said, Let me run now and carry glad tidings to the king, for the Lord has delivered him from the hand of his enemies.
20. And Joab said to him, You shall not be a messenger of glad tidings this day; you shall bear them another day; but on this day you shall bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.
21. And Joab said to Chusi, Go, report to the king all that you have seen. And Chusi did obeisance to Joab, and went out.
22. And Achimaas the son of Sadoc said again to Joab, Nay, let me also run after Chusi. And Joab said, Why would you thus run, my son? attend, you have no tidings for profit if you go.
23. And he said, Why should I not run? and Joab said to him, Run. And Achimaas ran along the way of Kechar, and outran Chusi.
24. And David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up on the top of the gate of the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone before him.
25. And the watchman cried out, and reported to the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there are good tidings in his mouth. And the man came and drew near.
26. And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman cried at the gate, and said, And look, another man running alone. And the king said, He also brings glad tidings.
27. And the watchman said, I see the running of the first as the running of Achimaas the son of Sadoc. And the king said, He is a good man, and will come to report glad tidings.
28. And Achimaas cried out and said to the king, Peace. And he did obeisance to the king with his face to the ground, and said, Blessed be the Lord your God, who has delivered up the men that lifted up their hands against my lord the king.
29. And the king said, Is the young man Abessalom safe? and Achimaas said, I saw a great multitude at the time of Joab's sending the king's servant and your servant, and I knew not what was there.
30. And the king said, Turn aside, stand still here. And he turned aside, and stood.
31. And, behold, Chusi came up, and said to the king, Let my lord the king hear glad tidings, for the Lord has avenged you this day upon all them that rose up against you.
32. And the king said to Chusi, Is it well with the young man Abessalom? and Chusi said, Let the enemies of my lord the king, and all whoever have risen up against him for evil, be as that young man.
33. And the king was troubled, and went to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and thus he said as he went, My son Abessalom, my son, my son Abessalom; would God I had died for you, even I had died for you, Abessalom, my son, my son!
** 19
1. And they brought Joab word, saying, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Abessalom.
2. And the victory was turned that day into mourning to all the people, for the people heard say that day, The king grieves after his son.
3. And the people stole away that day to go into the city, as people steal away when they are ashamed as they flee in the battle.
4. And the king hid his face: and the king cried with a loud voice, My son Abessalom! Abessalom my son!
5. And Joab went in to the king, into the house, and said, You have this day shamed the faces of all your servants that have delivered you this day, and have saved the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and of your concubines,
6. forasmuch as you love them that hate you, and hate them that love you; and you have this day declared, that your princes and your servants are nothing in your sight: for I know this day, that if Abessalom were alive, and all of us dead today, then it would have been right in your sight.
7. And now arise, and go forth, and speak comfortably to your servants; for I have sworn by the Lord, that unless you will go forth today, there shall not a man remain with you this night: and know for yourself, this thing will indeed be evil to you beyond all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now.
8. Then the king arose, and sat in the gate: and all the people reported, saying, Behold, the king sits in the gate. And all the people went in before the king to the gate; for Israel had fled every man to his tent.
9. And all the people disputed among all the tribes of Israel, saying, King David delivered us from all our enemies, and he rescued us from the hand of the Philistines: and now he has fled from the land, and from his kingdom, and from Abessalom.
10. And Abessalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle: and now why are you° silent about bringing back the king? And the word of all Israel came to the king.
11. And king David sent to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak to the elders of Israel, saying, Why are you° the last to bring back the king to his house? whereas the word of all Israel is come to the king to his house.
12. You° are my brethren, you° are my bones and my flesh: why are you° the last to bring back the king to his house?
13. And you° shall say to Amessai, Are you not my bone and my flesh? and now God do so to me, and more also, if you shall not be commander of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.
14. And he bowed the heart of all the men of Juda as that of one man; and they sent to the king, saying, Return you, and all your servants.
15. And the king returned, and came as far as Jordan. And the men of Juda came to Galgala on their way to meet the king, to cause the king to pass over Jordan.
16. And Semei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Baurim, hasted and went down with the men of Juda to meet king David.
17. And a thousand men of Benjamin were with him, and Siba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons with him, and his twenty servants with him: and they went directly down to Jordan before the king,
18. and they performed the service of bringing the king over; and there went over a ferry-boat to remove the household of the king, and to do that which was right in his eyes. And Semei the son of Gera fell on his face before the king, as he went over Jordan;
19. and said to the king, Let not my lord now impute iniquity, and remember not all the iniquity of your servant in the day in which my lord went out from Jerusalem, so that the king should mind it.
20. For your servant knows that I have sinned: and, behold, I am come today before all Israel and the house of Joseph, to go down and meet my lord the king.
21. And Abessai the son of Saruia answered and said, Shall not Semei therefore be put to death, because he cursed the Lord's anointed?
22. And David said, What have I to do with you, you° sons of Saruia, that you° as it were lie in wait against me this day? today no man in Israel shall be put to death, for I know not if I this day reign over Israel.
23. And the king said to Semei, You shall not die: and the king swore to him.
24. And Memphibosthe the son of Saul's son went down to meet the king, and had not dressed his feet, nor pared his nails, nor shaved himself, neither had he washed his garments, from the day that the king departed, until the day when he arrived in peace.
25. And it came to pass when he went into Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, Why did you not go with me, Memphibosthe?
26. And Memphibosthe said to him, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me; for your servant said to him, Saddle me the ass, and I will ride upon it, and go with the king; for your servant is lame.
27. And he has dealt deceitfully with your servant to my lord the king: but my lord the king is as an angel of God, and do you that which is good in your eyes.
28. For all the house of my father were but as dead men before my lord the king; yet you have set your servant among them that eat at your table: and what right have I any longer even to cry to the king?
29. And the king said to him, Why speak you any longer of your matters? I have said, You and Siba shall divide the land.
30. And Memphibosthe said to the king, Yes, let him take all, since my lord the king has come in peace to his house.
31. And Berzelli the Galaadite came down from Rogellim, and crossed over Jordan with the king, that he might conduct the king over Jordan.
32. And Berzelli was a very old man, eighty years old; and he had maintained the king when he lived in Manaim; for he was a very great man.
33. And the king said to Berzelli, You shall go over with me, and I will nourish your old age with me in Jerusalem.
34. And Berzelli said to the king, How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
35. I am this day eighty years old: can I then distinguish between good and evil? Can your servant taste any longer what I eat or drink? can I any longer hear the voice of singing men or singing women? and therefore shall your servant any longer be a burden to my lord the king?
36. Your servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why does the king return me this recompense?
37. Let, I pray you, your servant remain, and I will die in my city, by the tomb of my father and of my mother. And, behold, your servant Chamaam shall go over with my lord the king; and do you to him as it seems good in your eyes.
38. And the king said, Let Chamaam go over with me, and I will do to him what is good in my sight; and whatever you shall choose at my hand, I will do for you.
39. And all the people went over Jordan, and the king went over; and the king kissed Berzelli, and blessed him; and he returned to his place.
40. And the king went over to Galgala, and Chamaam went over with him: and all the men of Juda went over with the king, and also half the people of Israel.
41. And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, Why have our brethren the men of Juda stolen you away, and caused the king and all his house to pass over Jordan, and all the men of David with him?
42. And all the men of Juda answered the men of Israel, and said, Because the king is near of kin to us: and why were you thus angry concerning this matter? have we indeed eaten of the king's food? or has he given us a gift, or has he sent us a portion?
43. And the men of Israel answered the men of Juda, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we are older than you, we have also an interest in David above you: and why have you° thus insulted us, and why was not our advice taken before that of Juda, to bring back our king? And the speech of the men of Juda was sharper than the speech of the men of Israel.
** 20
1. And there was a transgressor so called there, and his name was Sabee, a Benjamite, the son of Bochori: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we any inheritance in the son of Jessae: to your tents, O Israel, every one.
2. And all the men of Israel went up from following David after Sabee the son of Bochori: but the men of Juda adhered to their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.
3. And David went into his house at Jerusalem: and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and he put them in a place of custody, and maintained them, and went not in to them; and they were kept living as widows, till the day of their death.
4. And the king said to Amessai, Call to me the men of Juda for three days, and do you be present here.
5. And Amessai went to call Juda, and delayed beyond the time which David appointed him.
6. And David said to Amessai, Now shall Sabee the son of Bochori do us more harm than Abessalom: now then take you with you the servants of your lord, and follow after him, lest he find for himself strong cities, so will he blind our eyes.
7. And there went out after him Amessai and the men of Joab, and the Cherethites, and the Phelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out from Jerusalem to pursue after Sabee the son of Bochori.
8. And they were by the great stone that is in Gabaon: and Amessai went in before them: and Joab had upon him a military cloak over his apparel, and over it he was girded with a dagger fastened upon his loins in its scabbard: and the dagger came out, it even came out and fell.
9. And Joab said to Amessai, Are you in health, my brother? and the right hand of Joab took hold of the beard of Amessai to kiss him.
10. And Amessai observed not the dagger that was in the hand of Joab: and Joab struck him with it on the loins, and his bowels were shed out upon the ground, and he did not repeat the blow, and he died: and Joab and Abessai his brother pursued after Sabee the son of Bochori.
11. And there stood over him one of the servants of Joab, and said, Who is he that is for Joab, and who is on the side of David following Joab?
12. And Amessai was weltering in blood in the midst of the way. And a man saw that all the people stood still; and he removed Amessai out of the path into a field, and he cast a garment upon him, because he saw every one that came to him standing still.
13. And when he was quickly removed from the road, every man of Israel passed after Joab to pursue after Sabee the son of Bochori.
14. And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Bethmacha; and all in Charri too were assembled, and followed after him.
15. And they came and besieged him in Abel and Phermacha: and they raised a mound against the city and it stood close to the wall; and all the people with Joab proposed to throw down the wall.
16. And a wise woman cried from the wall, and said, Hear, hear; say, I pray you°, to Joab, Draw near hither, and I will speak to him.
17. And he drew near to her, and the woman said to him, Are you Joab? and he said, I am. And she said to him, Hear the words of your handmaid; and Joab said, I do hear.
18. And she spoke, saying, Of old time they said thus, Surely one was asked in Abel, and Dan, whether the faithful in Israel failed in what they purposed; they will surely ask in Abel, even in like manner, whether they have failed.
19. I am a peaceful one of the strong ones in Israel; but you seek to destroy a city and a mother city in Israel: why do you seek to ruin the inheritance of the Lord?
20. And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should ruin or destroy.
21. Is not the case thus, that a man of mount Ephraim, Sabee, son of Bochori by name, has even lifted up his hand against king David? Give him only to me, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.
22. And the woman went in to all the people, and she spoke to all the city in her wisdom; and they took off the head of Sabee the son of Bochori; and took it away and threw it to Joab: and he blew the trumpet, and the people separated from the city away from him, every man to his tent: and Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
23. And Joab was over all the forces of Israel: and Banaias the son of Jodae was over the Cherethites and over the Phelethites.
24. And Adoniram was over the tribute: and Josaphath the son of Achiluth was recorder.
25. And Susa was scribe: and Sadoc and Abiathar were priests.
26. Moreover Iras the son of Iarin was priest to David.
** 21
1. And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David sought the face of the Lord. And the Lord said, There is guilt upon Saul and his house because of his bloody murder, whereby he killed the Gabaonites.
2. And King David called the Gabaonites, and said to them; —(now the Gabaonites are not the children of Israel, but are of the remnant of the Amorite, and the children of Israel had sworn to them: but Saul sought to strike them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Juda.)
3. And David said to the Gabaonites, What shall I do to you? and wherewithal shall I make atonement, that you° may bless the inheritance of the Lord?
4. And the Gabaonites said to him, We have no question about silver or gold with Saul and with his house; and there is no man for us to put to death in Israel.
5. And he said, What say you°? speak, and I will do it for you. And they said to the king, The man who would have made an end of us, and persecuted us, who plotted against us to destroy us, let us utterly destroy him, so that he shall have no standing in all the coasts of Israel.
6. Let one give us seven men of his sons, and let us hang them up in the sun to the Lord in Gabaon of Saul, as chosen out for the Lord. And the king said, I will give them.
7. But the king spared Memphibosthe son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the oath of the Lord that was between them, even between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
8. And the king took the two sons of Respha the daughter of Aia, whom she bore to Saul, Hermonoi and Memphibosthe, and the five sons of Michol daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Esdriel son of Berzelli the Moulathite.
9. And he gave them into the hand of the Gabaonites, and they hanged them up to the sun in the mountain before the lord: and they fell, even the seven together: moreover they were put to death in the days of harvest at the commencement, in the beginning of barley harvest.
10. And Respha the daughter of Aia took sackcloth, and fixed it for herself on the rock in the beginning of barley harvest, until water dropped upon them out of heaven: and she did not suffer the birds of the air to rest upon them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
11. And it was told David what Respha the daughter of Aia the concubine of Saul had done, and they were faint, and Dan, the son of Joa of the offspring of the giants overtook them.
12. And David went and took the bones of Saul, and the bones of Jonathan his son, from the men of the sons of Jabis Galaad, who stole them from the street of Baethsan; for the Philistines set them there in the day in which the Philistines struck Saul in Gelbue.
13. And he carried up thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son, and gathered the bones of them that had been hanged.
14. And they buried the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son, and the bones of them that had been hanged, in the land of Benjamin in the hill, in the sepulchre of Cis his father; and they did all things that the king commanded: and after this God listened to the prayers of the land.
15. And there was yet war between the Philistines and Israel: and David went down and his servants with him, and they fought with the Philistines, and David went.
16. And Jesbi, who was of the progeny of Rapha, and the head of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, who also was girded with a club, even he thought to strike David.
17. And Abessa the son of Saruia helped him and struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David swore, saying, You shall not any longer go out with us to battle, and you shall not quench the lamp of Israel.
18. And after this there was a battle again with the Philistines in Geth: then Sebocha the Astatothite killed Seph of the progeny of Rapha.
19. And there was a battle in Rom with the Philistines; and Eleanan son of Ariorgim the Bethleemite killed Goliath the Gittite; and the staff of his spear was as a weaver's beam.
20. And there was yet a battle in Geth: and there was a man of stature, and the fingers of his hands and the toes of his feet were six on each, four and twenty in number: and he also was born to Rapha.
21. And he defied Israel, and Jonathan son of Semei brother of David, struck him.
22. These four were born descendants of the giants in Geth, the family of Rapha; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
** 22
1. And David spoke to the Lord the words of this song, in the day in which the Lord rescued him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul.
2. And the song was thus: O Lord, my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer,
3. my God; he shall be to me my guard, I will trust in him: he is my protector, and the horn of my salvation, my helper, and my sure refuge; you shall save me from the unjust man.
4. I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised, and I shall be saved from my enemies.
5. For the troubles of death compassed me, the floods of iniquity amazed me:
6. the pangs of death surrounded me, the agonies of death prevented me.
7. When I am afflicted I will call upon the Lord, and will cry to my God, and he shall hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry shall come into his ears.
8. And the earth was troubled and quaked, and the foundations of heaven were confounded and torn asunder, because the Lord was angry with them.
9. There went up a smoke in his wrath, and fire out of his mouth devours: coals were kindled at it.
10. And he bowed the heavens, and came down, and there was darkness under his feet.
11. And he rode upon the cherubs and did fly, and was seen upon the wings of the wind.
12. And he made darkness his hiding-place; his tabernacle round about him was the darkness of waters, he condensed it with the clouds of the air.
13. At the brightness before him coals of fire were kindled.
14. The Lord thundered out of heaven, and the Most High uttered his voice.
15. And he sent forth arrows, and scattered them, and he flashed lightning, and dismayed them.
16. And the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuke of the Lord, at the blast of the breath of his anger.
17. He sent from above and took me; he drew me out of many waters.
18. He delivered me from my strong enemies, from them that hated me, for they were stronger than I.
19. The days of my affliction prevented me; but the Lord was my stay.
20. And he brought me into a wide place, and rescued me, because he delighted in me.
21. And the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness; even according to the purity of my hands did he recompense me.
22. Because, I kept the ways of the Lord, and did not wickedly depart from my God.
23. For all his judgments and his ordinances were before me: I departed not from them.
24. And I shall be blameless before him, and will keep myself from my iniquity.
25. And the Lord will recompense me according to my righteousness, and according to the purity of my hands in his eye-sight.
26. With the holy you will be holy, and with the perfect man you will be perfect,
27. and with the excellent you will be excellent, and with the froward you will be froward.
28. And you will save the poor people, and will bring down the eyes of the haughty.
29. For you, Lord, are my lamp, and the Lord shall shine forth to me in my darkness.
30. For by you shall I run as a girded man, and by my God shall I leap over a wall.
31. As for the Mighty One, his way is blameless: the word of the Lord is strong and tried in the fire: he is a protector to all that put their trust in him.
32. Who is strong, but the Lord? and who will be a Creator except our God?
33. It is the Mighty One who strengthens me with might, and has prepared my way without fault.
34. He makes my feet like hart's feet, and sets me upon the high places.
35. He teaches my hands to war, and has broken a brazen bow by my arm.
36. And you have given me the shield of my salvation, and your propitious dealing has increased me,
37. so as to make room under me for my going, and my legs did not totter.
38. I will pursue my enemies, and will utterly destroy them; and I will not turn again till I have consumed them.
39. And I will crush them, and they shall not rise; and they shall fall under my feet.
40. And you shall strengthen me with power for the war; you shall cause them that rise up against me to bow down under me.
41. And you have caused my enemies to flee before me, even them that hated me, and you have slain them.
42. They shall cry, and there shall be no helper; to the Lord, but he hearkens not to them.
43. And I ground them as the dust of the earth, I beat them small as the mire of the streets.
44. And you shall deliver me from the striving of the peoples, you shall keep me to be the head of the Gentiles: a people which I knew not served me.
45. The strange children feigned obedience to me; they listened to me as soon as they heard.
46. The strange children shall be cast away, and shall be overthrown out of their hiding places.
47. The Lord lives, and blessed be my guardian, and my God, my strong keeper, shall be exalted.
48. The Lord who avenges me is strong, chastening the nations under me,
49. and bringing me out from my enemies: and you shall set me on high from among those that rise up against me: you shall deliver me from the violent man.
50. Therefore will I confess to you, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.
51. He magnifies the salvation of his king, and works mercy for his anointed, even for David and for his seed for ever.
** 23
1. And these are the last words of David. Faithful is David the son of Jessae, and faithful the man whom the Lord raised up to be the anointed of the God of Jacob, and beautiful are the psalms of Israel.
2. The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me, and his word was upon my tongue.
3. The God of Israel says, A watchman out of Israel spoke to me a parable: I said among men, How will you° strengthen the fear of the anointed?
4. And in the morning light of God, let the sun arise in the morning, from the light of which the Lord passed on, and as it were from the rain of the tender grass upon the earth.
5. For my house is not so with the Mighty One: for he has made an everlasting covenant with me, ready, guarded at every time; for all my salvation and all my desire is, that the wicked should not flourish.
6. All these are as a thorn thrust forth, for they shall not be taken with the hand,
7. and a man shall not labor among them; and one shall have that which is fully armed with iron, and the staff of a spear, an he shall burn them with fire, and they shall be burnt in their shame.
8. These are the names of the mighty men of David: Jebosthe the Chananite is a captain of the third part: Adinon the Asonite, he drew his sword against eight hundred soldiers at once.
9. And after him Eleanan the son of his uncle, son of Dudi who was among the three mighty men with David; and when he defied the Philistines they were gathered there to war, and the men of Israel went up.
10. He arose an struck the Philistines, until his hand was weary, and his hand clave to the sword: and the Lord wrought a great salvation in that day, and the people rested behind him only to strip the slain.
11. And after him Samaia the son of Asa the Arachite: and the Philistines were gathered to Theria; and there was there a portion of ground full of lentiles; and the people fled before the Philistines.
12. And he stood firm in the midst of the portion, and rescued it, and struck the Philistines; and the Lord wrought a great deliverance.
13. And three out of the thirty went down, and came to Cason to David, to the cave of Odollam; and there was an army of the Philistines, and they encamped in the valley of Raphain.
14. And David was then in the strong hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethleem.
15. And David longed, and said, Who will give me water to drink out of the well that is in Bethleem by the gate? now the band of the Philistines was then in Bethleem.
16. And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well that was in Bethleem in the gate: and they took it, and brought it to David, and he would not drink it, but poured it out before the Lord.
17. And he said, O Lord, forbid that I should do this, that I should drink of the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives: and he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.
18. And Abessa the brother of Joab the son of Saruia, he was chief among the three, and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he killed; and he had a name among three.
19. Of those three he was most honorable, and he became a chief over them, but he reached not to the first three.
20. And Banaeas the son of Jodae, he was abundant in mighty deeds, from Cabeseel, and he struck the two sons of Ariel of Moab: and he went down and struck a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.
21. He struck an Egyptian, a wonderful man, and in the hand of the Egyptian was a spear as the side of a ladder; and he went down to him with a staff, and snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
22. These things did Banaeas the son of Jodae, and he had a name among the three mighty men.
23. He was honorable among the second three, but he reached not to the first three: and David made him his reporter. And these are the names of King David's mighty men.

** 24
1. And the Lord caused his anger to burn forth again in Israel, and Satan stirred up David against them, saying, Go, number Israel and Juda.
2. And the king said to Joab commander of the host, who was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel and Juda, from Dan even to Bersabee, and number the people, and I will know the number of the people.
3. And Joab said to the king, Now may the Lord add to the people a hundred-fold as many as they are, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it: but why does my lord the king desire this thing?
4. Nevertheless the word of the king prevailed against Joab an the captains of the host: And Joab and the captains of the host went out before the king to number the people of Israel.
5. And they went over Jordan, and encamped in Aroer, on the right of the city which is in the midst of the valley of Gad and Eliezer.
6. And they came to Galaad, and into the land of Thabason, which is Adasai, and they came to Danidan and Udan, and compassed Sidon.
7. And they came to Mapsar of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Evite and the Chananite: and they came by the South of Juda to Bersabee.
8. And they compassed the whole land; and they arrived at Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
9. And Joab gave in the number of the census of the people to the king: and Israel consisted of eight hundred thousand men of might that drew sword; and the men of Juda, five hundred thousand fighting men.
10. And the heart of David struck him after he had numbered the people; and David said to the Lord, I have sinned grievously, O Lord, in what I have now done: remove, I pray you, the iniquity of your servant, for I have been exceedingly foolish.
11. And David rose early in the morning, and the word of the Lord came to the prophet Gad, the seer, saying, Go, and speak to David, saying,
12. Thus says the Lord, I bring one of three things upon you: now choose you one of them, and I will do it to you.
13. And Gad went in to David, and told him, and said to him, Choose one of these things to befall you, whether there shall come upon you for three years famine in your land; or that you should flee three months before your enemies, and they should pursue you; or that there should be for three days mortality in your land. Now then decide, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
14. And David said to Gad, On every side I am much straitened: let me fall now into the hands of the Lord, for his compassions are very many; and let me not fall into the hands of man.
15. So David chose for himself the mortality: and they were the days of wheat harvest; and the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from morning till noon, and the plague began among the people; and there died of the people from Dan even to Bersabee seventy thousand men.
16. And the angel of the Lord stretched out his hand against Jerusalem to destroy it, and the Lord repented of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough now, withhold your hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor of Orna the Jebusite.
17. And David spoke to the Lord when he saw the angel striking the people, and he said, Behold, it is I that have done wrong, but these sheep what have they done? Let your hand, I pray you, be upon me, and upon my father's house.
18. And Gad came to David in that day, and said to him, Go up, and set up to the Lord and altar in the threshing floor of Orna the Jebusite.
19. And David went up according to the word of Gad, as the Lord commanded him.
20. And Orna looked out, and saw the king and his servants coming on before him: and Orna went forth, and did obeisance to the king with his face to the earth.
21. And Orna said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? and David said, To buy of you the threshing floor, in order to build an altar to the Lord that the plague may be restrained from off the people.
22. And Orna said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer to the Lord that which is good in his eyes: behold, here are oxen for a whole burnt offering, and the wheels and furniture of the oxen for wood.
23. Orna gave all to the king: and Orna said to the king, The Lord your God bless you.
24. And the king said to Orna, Nay, but I will surely buy it of you at a fair price, and I will not offer to the Lord my God a whole burnt offering for nothing. So David purchased the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
25. And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered up whole burnt offerings and peace-offerings: and Solomon made an addition to the altar afterwards, for it was little at first. And the Lord listened to the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
