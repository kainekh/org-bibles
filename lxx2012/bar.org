#+TITLE: BARUCH 
* 1 
1 And these are the words of the book, which Baruch the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, the son of Sedecias, the son of Asadias, the son of Chelcias, wrote in Babylon, 
2. In the fifth year, and in the seventh day of the month, what time as the Chaldeans took Jerusalem, and burnt it with fire. 
3. And Baruch did read the words of this book in the hearing of Jechonias the son of Joachim king of Juda, and in the ears of all the people that came to hear the book, 
4. And in the hearing of the nobles, and of the king's sons, and in the hearing of the elders, and of all the people, from the lowest to the highest, even of all them that lived at Babylon by the river Sud. 
5. Whereupon they wept, fasted, and prayed before the Lord. 
6. They made also a collection of money according to every man's power: 
7. And they sent it to Jerusalem to Joachim the high priest, the son of Chelcias, son of Salom, and to the priests, and to all the people which were found with him at Jerusalem, 
8. At the same time when he received the vessels of the house of the Lord, that were carried out of the temple, to return them into the land of Juda, the tenth day of the month Sivan, namely, silver vessels, which Sedecias the son of Josias king of Juda had made, 
9. After that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried away Jechonias, and the princes, and the captives, and the mighty men, and the people of the land, from Jerusalem, and brought them to Babylon. 
10. And they said, Behold, we have sent you money to buy you burnt offerings, and sin offerings, and incense, and prepare you° manna, and offer upon the altar of the Lord our God; 
11. And pray for the life of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and for the life of Balthasar his son, that their days may be upon earth as the days of heaven: 
12. And the Lord will give us strength, and lighten our eyes, and we shall live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and under the shadow of Balthasar his son, and we shall serve them many days, and find favor in their sight. 
13. Pray for us also to the Lord our God, for we have sinned against the Lord our God; and to this day the fury of the Lord and his wrath is not turned from us. 
14. And you° shall read this book which we have sent to you, to make confession in the house of the Lord, upon the feasts and solemn days. 
15. And you° shall say, To the Lord our God belongs righteousness, but to us the confusion of faces, as it is come to pass this day, to them of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
16. And to our kings, and to our princes, and to our priests, and to our prophets, and to our fathers: 
17. For we have sinned before the Lord, 
18. And disobeyed him, and have not listened to the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in the commandments that he gave us openly: 
19. Since the day that the Lord brought our forefathers out of the land of Egypt, to this present day, we have been disobedient to the Lord our God, and we have been negligent in not hearing his voice. 
20. Therefore the evils cleaved to us, and the curse, which the Lord appointed by Moses his servant at the time that he brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, to give us a land that flows with milk and honey, like as it is to see this day. 
21. Nevertheless we have not listened to the voice of the Lord our God, according to all the words of the prophets, whom he sent to us: 
22. But every man followed the imagination of his own wicked heart, to serve strange gods, and to do evil in the sight of the Lord our God. 
* 2 
1. Therefore the Lord has made good his word, which he pronounced against us, and against our judges that judged Israel, and against our kings, and against our princes, and against the men of Israel and Juda, 
2. To bring upon us great plagues, such as never happened under the whole heaven, as it came to pass in Jerusalem, according to the things that were written in the law of Moses; 
3. That a man should eat the flesh of his own son, and the flesh of his own daughter. 
4. Moreover he has delivered them to be in subjection to all the kingdoms that are round about us, to be as a reproach and desolation among all the people round about, where the Lord has scattered them. 
5. Thus we were cast down, and not exalted, because we have sinned against the Lord our God, and have not been obedient to his voice. 
6. To the Lord our God appertains righteousness: but to us and to our fathers open shame, as appears this day. 
7. For all these plagues are come upon us, which the Lord has pronounced against us 
8. Yet have we not prayed before the Lord, that we might turn every one from the imaginations of his wicked heart. 
9. Therefore the Lord watched over us for evil, and the Lord has brought it upon us: for the Lord is righteous in all his works which he has commanded us. 
10. Yet we have not listened to his voice, to walk in the commandments of the Lord, that he has set before us. 
11. And now, O Lord God of Israel, that have brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and high arm, and with signs, and with wonders, and with great power, and have gotten yourself a name, as appears this day: 
12. O Lord our God, we have sinned, we have done ungodly, we have dealt unrighteously in all your ordinances. 
13. Let your wrath turn from us: for we are but a few left among the heathen, where you have scattered us. 
14. Hear our prayers, O Lord, and our petitions, and deliver us for your own sake, and give us favor in the sight of them which have led us away: 
15. That all the earth may know that you are the Lord our God, because Israel and his posterity is called by your name. 
16. O Lord, look down from your holy house, and consider us: bow down your ear, O Lord, to hear us. 
17. Open your eyes, and behold; for the dead that are in the graves, whose souls are taken from their bodies, will give to the Lord neither praise nor righteousness: 
18. But the soul that is greatly vexed, which goes stooping and feeble, and the eyes that fail, and the hungry soul, will give you praise and righteousness, O Lord. 
19. Therefore we do not make our humble supplication before you, O Lord our God, for the righteousness of our fathers, and of our kings. 
20. For you have sent out your wrath and indignation upon us, as you have spoken by your servants the prophets, saying, 
21. Thus says the Lord, Bow down your shoulders to serve the king of Babylon: so shall you° remain in the land that I gave to your fathers. 
22. But if you° will not hear the voice of the Lord, to serve the king of Babylon, 
23. I will cause to cease out of the cites of Judah, and from without Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: and the whole land shall be desolate of inhabitants. 
24. But we would not listen to your voice, to serve the king of Babylon: therefore have you made good the words that you spoke by your servants the prophets, namely, that the bones of our kings, and the bones of our fathers, should be taken out of their place. 
25. And, behold, they are cast out to the heat of the day, and to the frost of the night, and they died in great miseries by famine, by sword, and by pestilence. 
26. And the house which is called by your name have you laid waste, as it is to be seen this day, for the wickedness of the house of Israel and the house of Juda. 
27. O Lord our God, you have dealt with us after all your goodness, and according to all that great mercy of your, 
28. As you spoke by your servant Moses in the day when you did command him to write the law before the children of Israel, saying, 
29. If you° will not hear my voice, surely this very great multitude shall be turned into a small number among the nations, where I will scatter them. 
30. For I knew that they would not hear me, because it is a stiff-necked people: but in the land of their captivities they shall remember themselves. 
31. And shall know that I am the Lord their God: for I will give them an heart, and ears to hear: 
32. And they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, and think upon my name, 
33. And return from their stiff neck, and from their wicked deeds: for they shall remember the way of their fathers, which sinned before the Lord. 
34. And I will bring them again into the land which I promised with an oath to their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and they shall be lords of it: and I will increase them, and they shall not be diminished. 
35. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them to be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will no more drive my people of Israel out of the land that I have given them. 
* 3 
1. O Lord Almighty, God of Israel, the soul in anguish the troubled spirit, cries to you. 
2. Hear, O Lord, and have mercy; for you are merciful: and have pity upon us, because we have sinned before you. 
3. For you endure for ever, and we perish utterly. 
4. O Lord Almighty, you God of Israel, hear now the prayers of the dead Israelites, and of their children, which have sinned before you, and not listened to the voice of you their God: for the which cause these plagues cleave to us. 
5. Remember not the iniquities of our forefathers: but think upon your power and your name now at this time. 
6. For you are the Lord our God, and you, O Lord, will we praise. 
7. And for this cause you have put your fear in our hearts, to the intent that we should call upon your name, and praise you in our captivity: for we have called to mind all the iniquity of our forefathers, that sinned before you. 
8. Behold, we are yet this day in our captivity, where you have scattered us, for a reproach and a curse, and to be subject to payments, according to all the iniquities of our fathers, which departed from the Lord our God. 
9. Hear, Israel, the commandments of life: give ear to understand wisdom. 
10. How is it Israel, that you are in your enemies' land, that you have become old in a strange country, that you are defiled with the dead, 
11. That you are counted with them that go down into the grave? 
12. You have forsaken the fountain of wisdom. 
13. For if you had walked in the way of God, you should have dwelled in peace for ever. 
14. Learn where is wisdom, where is strength, where is understanding; that you may know also where is length of days, and life, where is the light of the eyes, and peace. 
15. Who has found out her place? or who has come into her treasures? 
16. Where are the princes of the heathen become, and such as ruled the beasts upon the earth; 
17. They that had their pastime with the fowls of the air, and they that hoarded up silver and gold, wherein men trust, and made no end of their getting? 
18. For they that wrought in silver, and were so careful, and whose works are unsearchable, 
19. They are vanished and gone down to the grave, and others are come up in their steads. 
20. Young men have seen light, and lived upon the earth: but the way of knowledge have they not known, 
21. Nor understood the paths thereof, nor laid hold of it: their children were far off from that way. 
22. It has not been heard of in Chanaan, neither has it been seen in Theman. 
23. The Agarenes that seek wisdom upon earth, the merchants of Meran and of Theman, the authors of fables, and searchers out of understanding; none of these have known the way of wisdom, or remember her paths. 
24. O Israel, how great is the house of God! and how large is the place of his possession! 
25. Great, and has none end; high, and unmeasurable. 
26. There were the giants famous from the beginning, that were of so great stature, and so expert in war. 
27. Those did not the Lord choose, neither gave he the way of knowledge to them: 
28. But they were destroyed, because they had no wisdom, and perished through their own foolishness. 
29. Who has gone up into heaven, and taken her, and brought her down from the clouds? 
30. Who has gone over the sea, and found her, and will bring her for pure gold? 
31. No man knows her way, nor thinks of her path. 
32. But he that knows all things knows her, and has found her out with his understanding: he that prepared the earth for evermore has filled it with four-footed beasts: 
33. He that sends forth light, and it goes, calls it again, and it obeys him with fear. 
34. The stars shined in their watches, and rejoiced: when he calls them, they say, Here we be; and so with cheerfulness they showed light to him that made them. 
35. This is our God, and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison of him 
36. He has found out all the way of knowledge, and has given it to Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved. 
37. Afterward did he show himself upon earth, and conversed with men. 
* 4 
1. This is the book of the commandments of God, and the law that endures for ever: all they that keep it shall come to life; but such as leave it shall die. 
2. Turn you, O Jacob, and take hold of it: walk in the presence of the light thereof, that you may be illuminated. 
3. Give not your honor to another, nor the things that are profitable to you to a strange nation. 
4. O Israel, happy are we: for things that are pleasing to God are made known to us. 
5. Be of good cheer, my people, the memorial of Israel. 
6. You° were sold to the nations, not for your destruction: but because you° moved God to wrath, you° were delivered to the enemies. 
7. For you° provoked him that made you by sacrificing to devils, and not to God. 
8. You° have forgotten the everlasting God, that brought you up; and you° have grieved Jerusalem, that nursed you. 
9. For when she saw the wrath of God coming upon you, she said, Listen, O you° that dwell about Sion: God has brought upon me great mourning; 
10. For I saw the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting brought upon them. 
11. With joy did I nourish them; but sent them away with weeping and mourning. 
12. Let no man rejoice over me, a widow, and forsaken of many, who for the sins of my children am left desolate; because they departed from the law of God. 
13. They knew not his statutes, nor walked in the ways of his commandments, nor trod in the paths of discipline in his righteousness. 
14. Let them that dwell about Sion come, and remember you° the captivity of my sons and daughters, which the Everlasting has brought upon them. 
15. For he has brought a nation upon them from far, a shameless nation, and of a strange language, who neither reverenced old man, nor pitied child. 
16. These have carried away the dear beloved children of the widow, and left her that was alone desolate without daughters. 
17. But what can I help you? 
18. For he that brought these plagues upon you will deliver you from the hands of your enemies. 
19. Go your way, O my children, go your way: for I am left desolate. 
20. I have put off the clothing of peace, and put upon me the sackcloth of my prayer: I will cry to the Everlasting in my days. 
21. Be of good cheer, O my children, cry to the Lord, and he will deliver you from the power and hand of the enemies. 
22. For my hope is in the Everlasting, that he will save you; and joy is come to me from the Holy One, because of the mercy which shall soon come to you from the Everlasting our Saviour. 
23. For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God will give you to me again with joy and gladness for ever. 
24. Like as now the neighbors of Sion have seen your captivity: so shall they see shortly your salvation from our God which shall come upon you with great glory, and brightness of the Everlasting. 
25. My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come upon you from God: for your enemy has persecuted you; but shortly you shall see his destruction, and shall tread upon his neck. 
26. My delicate ones have gone rough ways, and were taken away as a flock caught of the enemies. 
27. Be of good comfort, O my children, and cry to God: for you° shall be remembered of him that brought these things upon you. 
28. For as it was your mind to go astray from God: so, being returned, seek him ten times more. 
29. For he that has brought these plagues upon you shall bring you everlasting joy with your salvation. 
30. Take a good heart, O Jerusalem: for he that gave you that name will comfort you. 
31. Miserable are they that afflicted you, and rejoiced at your fall. 
32. Miserable are the cities which your children served: miserable is she that received your sons. 
33. For as she rejoiced at your ruin, and was glad of your fall: so shall she be grieved for her own desolation. 
34. For I will take away the rejoicing of her great multitude, and her pride shall be turned into mourning. 
35. For fire shall come upon her from the Everlasting, long to endure; and she shall be inhabited of devils for a great time. 
36. O Jerusalem, look about you toward the east, and behold the joy that comes to you from God. 
37. Behold, your sons come, whom you sent away, they come gathered together from the east to the west by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the glory of God. 
* 5 
1. Put off, O Jerusalem, the garment of mourning and affliction, and put on the comeliness of the glory that comes from God for ever. 
2. Cast about you a double garment of the righteousness which comes from God; and set a diadem on your head of the glory of the Everlasting. 
3. For God will show your brightness to every country under heaven. 
4. For your name shall be called of God for ever The peace of righteousness, and The glory of God's worship. 
5. Arise, O Jerusalem, and stand on high, and look about toward the east, and behold your children gathered from the west to the east by the word of the Holy One, rejoicing in the remembrance of God. 
6. For they departed from you on foot, and were led away of their enemies: but God brings them to you exalted with glory, as children of the kingdom. 
7. For God has appointed that every high hill, and banks of long continuance, should be cast down, and valleys filled up, to make even the ground, that Israel may go safely in the glory of God, 
8. Moreover even the woods and every sweet smelling tree shall overshadow Israel by the commandment of God. 
9. For God shall lead Israel with joy in the light of his glory with the mercy and righteousness that comes from him.
