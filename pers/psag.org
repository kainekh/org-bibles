3. And he shall be as a tree planted by the brooks of waters, which shall yield its fruit in its season, and its leaf shall not fall off; and whatever he shall do shall be prospered.
4. Not so the ungodly; —not so: but rather as the chaff which the wind scatters away from the face of the earth.

11. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice in him with trembling.

4. For you are not a god that desires iniquity; neither shall the worker of wickedness dwell with you.
5. Neither shall the transgressors continue in your sight: you hate, O Lord, all them that work iniquity.
6. You will destroy all that speak falsehood: the Lord abhors the bloody and deceitful man.
7. But I will enter into your house in the multitude of your mercy: I will worship in your fear toward your holy temple.
8. Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make my way plain before your face.
9. For there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is vain; their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit.
10. Judge them, O God; let them fail of their counsels: cast them out according to the abundance of their ungodliness; for they have provoked you, O Lord.
11. But let all that trust on you be glad in you: they shall exult for ever, and you shall dwell among them; and all that love your name shall rejoice in you.
12. For you, Lord, shall bless the righteous: you have compassed us as with a shield of favor.

7. sheep and all oxen, yes and the cattle of the field;
8. the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea, the creatures passing through the paths of the sea.
9. O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is your name in all the earth!

29. He lies in wait with rich men in secret places, in order to kill the innocent: his eyes are set against the poor.

5. For they have pulled down what you did frame, but what has the righteous done?
6. The Lord is in his holy temple, as for the Lord, his throne is in heaven: his eyes look upon the poor, his eyelids try the sons of men.

2. The Lord looked down from heaven upon the sons of men, to see if there were any that understood, or sought after god.
3. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become good for nothing, there is none that does good, no not one. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood: destruction and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes.

8. Keep me as the apple of the eye from those that resist your right hand: you shall screen me by the covering of your wings,
9. from the face of the ungodly that have afflicted me: my enemies have compassed about my soul.
10. They have enclosed themselves with their own fat: their mouth has spoken pride.
11. They have now cast me out and compassed me round about: they have set their eyes so as to bow them down to the ground.

15. But I shall appear in righteousness before your face: I shall be satisfied when your glory appears.

1. I will love you, O Lord, my strength.

6. And when I was afflicted I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of this holy temple, and my cry shall enter before him, even into his ears.
7. Then the earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains were disturbed, and were shaken, because God was angry with them.
8. There went up a smoke in his wrath, and fire burst into a flame at his presence: coals were kindled at it.
9. And he bowed the heaven, and came down: and thick darkness was under his feet.
10. And he mounted on cherubs and flew: he flew on the wings of winds.
11. And he made darkness his secret place: round about him was his tabernacle, even dark water in the clouds of the air.
12. At the brightness before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire.
13. The Lord also thundered from heaven, and the Highest uttered his voice.
14. And he sent forth his weapons, and scattered them; and multiplied lightnings, and routed them.
15. And the springs of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed, at your rebuke, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of your wrath.

19. And he brought me out into a wide place: he will deliver me, because he has pleasure in me.
20. And the Lord will recompense me according to my righteousness; even according to the purity of my hands will he recompense me.
21. For I have kept the way of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God.
22. For all his judgments were before me, and his ordinances departed not from me.
23. And I shall be blameless with hem, and shall keep myself from my iniquity.

25. With the holy you will be holy; and with the innocent man you will be innocent.
26. And with the excellent man you will be excellent; and with the perverse you will show frowardness.
27. For you will save the lowly people, and will humble the eyes of the proud.
28. For you, O Lord, will light my lamp: my God, you will lighten my darkness.
29. For by you shall I be delivered from a troop; and by my God I will pass over a wall.
30. As for my God, his way is perfect: the oracles of the Lord are tried in the fire; he is a protector of all them that hope in him.
31. For who is God but the Lord? and who is a God except our God?
32. It is God that girds me with strength, and has made my way blameless:
33. who strengthens my feet as hart's feet, and sets me upon high places.
34. He instructs my hands for war: and you have made my arms as a brazen bow.
35. And you have made me secure in my salvation: and your right hand has helped me, and your correction has upheld me to the end; yes, your correction itself shall instruct me.

37. I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them; and I will not turn back until they are consumed.
38. I will dash them to pieces and they shall not be able to stand: they shall fall under my feet.
39. For you have girded me with strength for war: you have beaten down under me all that rose up against me.
40. And you have made my enemies turn their backs before me; and you have destroyed them that hated me.
41. They cried, but there was no deliverer: even to the Lord, but he listened not to them.
42. I will grind them as the mud of the streets: and I will beat them small as dust before the wind.
43. Deliver me from the gain sayings of the people: you shall make me head of the Gentiles: a people whom I knew not served me,
44. at the hearing of the ear they obeyed me: the strange children lied to me.
45. The strange children waxed old, and fell away from their paths through lameness.
46. The Lord lives; and blessed be my God; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
47. It is God that avenges me, and has subdued the nations under me;
48. my deliverer from angry enemies: you shall set me on high above them that rise up against me: you shall deliver me from the unrighteous man.
49. Therefore will I confess to you, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.

0. (38) A Psalm of David for remembrance concerning the Sabbath-day.
1. O Lord, rebuke me not in your wrath, neither chasten me in your anger.
2. For your weapons are fixed in me, and you have pressed your hand heavily upon me.
3. For there is no health in my flesh because of your anger; there is no peace to my bones because of my sins.
4. For my transgressions have gone over my head: they have pressed heavily upon me like a weighty burden.
5. My bruises have become noisome and corrupt, because of my foolishness.
6. I have been wretched and bowed down continually: I went with a mourning countenance all the day.
7. For my soul is filled with mockings; and there is no health in my flesh.
8. I have been afflicted and brought down exceedingly: I have roared for the groaning of my heart.
9. But all my desire is before you; and my groaning is not hidden from you.
10. My heart is troubled, my strength has failed me; and the light of my eyes is not with me.
11. My friends and my neighbors drew near before me, and stood still; and my nearest of kin stood afar off.
12. While they pressed hard upon me that sought my soul: and they that sought my hurt spoke vanities, and devised deceits all the day.
13. But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and was as a dumb man not opening his mouth.
14. And I was as a man that hears not, and who has no reproofs in his mouth.
15. For I hoped in you, O Lord: you will hear, O Lord my God.
16. For I said, Lest my enemies rejoice against me: for when my feet were moved, they spoke boastingly against me.
17. For I am ready for plagues, and my grief is continually before me.
18. For I will declare my iniquity, and be distressed for my sin.
19. But my enemies live, and are mightier than I: and they that hate me unjustly are multiplied.
20. They that reward evil for good slandered me; because I followed righteousness.
21. Forsake me not, O Lord my God: depart not from me.

1. I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I set a guard on my mouth, while the sinner stood in my presence.
2. I was dumb, and humbled myself, and kept silence from good words; and my grief was renewed.
3. My heart grew hot within me, and a fire would kindle in my meditation: I spoke with my tongue,
4. O Lord, make me to know my end, and the number of my days, what it is; that I may know what I lack.
5. Behold, you have made my days old; and my existence is as nothing before you: nay, every man living is altogether vanity. Pause.
6. Surely man walks in a shadow; nay, he is disquieted in vain: he lays up treasures, and knows not for whom he shall gather them.
7. And now what is my expectation? is it not the Lord? and my ground of hope is with you. Pause.
8. Deliver me from all my transgressions: you have made me a reproach to the foolish.
9. I was dumb, and opened not my mouth; for you are he that made me.
10. Remove your scourges from me: I have fainted by reason of the strength of your hand.
11. You chasten man with rebukes for iniquity, and you make his life to consume away like a spider's web; nay, every man is disquieted in vain. Pause.
12. O Lord, listen to my prayer and my supplication: attend to my tears: be not silent, for I am a sojourner in the land, and a stranger, as all my fathers were.
13. Spare me, that I may be refreshed, before I depart, and be no more.

2. And he brought me up out of a pit of misery, and from miry clay: and he set my feet on a rock, and ordered my goings aright.
3. And he put a new song into my mouth, even a hymn to our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall hope in the Lord.
4. Blessed is the man whose hope is in the name of the Lord, and who has not regarded vanities and false frenzies.
5. O Lord my God, you have multiplied your wonderful works, and in your thoughts there is none who shall be likened to you: I declared and spoke of them: they exceeded number.
6 . Sacrifice and offering you would not; but a body have you prepared me: whole burnt offering and sacrifice for sin you did not require.
7. Then I said, Behold, I come: in the volume of the book it is written concerning me,
8. I desired to do your will, O my God, and your law in the midst of my heart.
9. I have preached righteousness in the great congregation; behold! I will not refrain my lips; O Lord, you know my righteousness.
10. I have not hid your truth within my heart, and I have declared your salvation; I have not hid your mercy and your truth from the great congregation.
11. But you, Lord, remove not your compassion far from me; your mercy and your truth have helped me continually.
12. For innumerable evils have encompassed me; my transgressions have taken hold of me, and I could not see; they are multiplied more than the hairs of my head; and my heart has failed me.
13. Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; O Lord, draw near to help me.
14. Let those that seek my soul, to destroy it, be ashamed and confounded together; let those that wish me evil be turned backward and put to shame.
15. Let those that say to me, Aha, aha, quickly receive shame for their reward.
16. Let all those that seek you, O Lord, exult and rejoice in you; and let them that love your salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified.
17. But I am poor and needy; the Lord will take care of me; you are my helper, and my defender, O my God, delay not.

8. They denounced a wicked word against me, saying, Now that he lies, shall he not rise up again?

2. Your hand utterly destroyed the heathen, and you did plant them: you did afflict the nations, and cast them out.
3. For they inherited not the land by their own sword, and their own arm did not deliver them; but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your countenance, because you were well pleased in them.
4. You are indeed my King and my God, who command deliverances for Jacob.

17. All these things are come upon us: but we have not forgotten you, neither have we dealt unrighteously in your covenant.
18. And our heart has not gone back; but you have turned aside our paths from your way.
19. For you have laid us low in a place of affliction, and the shadow of death has covered us.
20. If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread out our hands to a strange god; shall not God search these things out?

0. (73) A Psalm for Asaph.
1. How good is God to Israel, to the upright in heart!
2. But my feet were almost overthrown; my goings very nearly slipped.
3. For I was jealous of the transgressors, beholding the tranquility of sinners.
4. For there is no sign of reluctance in their death: and they have firmness under their affliction.
5. They are not in the troubles of other men; and they shall not be scourged with other men.
6. Therefore pride has possessed them; they have clothed themselves with their injustice and ungodliness.
7. Their injustice shall go forth as out of fatness: they have fulfilled their intention.
8. They have taken counsel and spoken in wickedness: they have uttered unrighteousness loftily.
9. They have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue has gone through upon the earth.
10. Therefore shall my people return hither: and full days shall be found with them.
11. And they said, How does God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?
12. Behold, these are the sinners, and they that prosper always: they have possessed wealth.
13. And I said, Verily in vain have I justified my heart, and washed my hands in innocency.
14. For I was plagued all the day, and my reproof was every morning.
15. If I said, I will speak thus; behold, I should have broken covenant with the generation of your children.
16. And I undertook to understand this, but it is too hard for me,
17. until I go into the sanctuary of God; and so understand the latter end.
18. Surely you have appointed judgments to them because of their crafty dealings: you have cast them down when they were lifted up.
19. How have they become desolate! suddenly they have failed: they have perished because of their iniquity.
20. As the dream of one awakening, O Lord, in your city you will despise their image.
21. For my heart has rejoiced, and my reins have been gladdened.
22. But I was vile and knew not: I became brutish before you.
23. Yet I am continually with you: you have holden my right hand.
24. You have guided me by your counsel, and you have taken me to yourself with glory.
25. For what have I in heaven but you? and what have I desired upon the earth beside you?
26. My heart and my flesh have failed: but God is the strength of my heart, and God is my portion for ever.
27. For, behold, they that remove themselves far from you shall perish: you have destroyed every one that goes a whoring from you.
28. But it is good for me to cleave close to God, to put my trust in the Lord; that I may proclaim all your praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion.

1. Therefore have you rejected us, O God, for ever? therefore is your wrath kindled against the sheep of your pasture?
2. Remember your congregation which you have purchased from the beginning; you did ransom the rod of your inheritance; this mount Sion wherein you have lived.
3. Lift up your hands against their pride continually; because of all that the enemy has done wickedly in your holy places.
4. And they that hate you have boasted in the midst of your feast; they have set up their standards for signs,
5. ignorantly as it were in the entrance above;
6. they cut down its doors at once with axes as in a wood of trees; they have broken it down with hatchet and stone cutter.
7. They have burnt your sanctuary with fire to the ground; they have profaned the habitation of your name.
8. They have said in their heart, even all their kindred together, Come, let us abolish the feasts of the Lord from the earth.
9. We have not seen our signs; there is no longer a prophet; and God will not know us any more.
10. How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach? shall the enemy provoke your name forever?
11. Therefore turn you away your hand, and your right hand from the midst of your bosom for ever?
12. But God is our King of old; he has wrought salvation in the midst of the earth.
13. You did establish the sea, in your might, you did break to pieces the heads of the dragons in the water.
14. You did break to pieces the heads of the dragon; you did give him for meat to the Ethiopian nations.
15. You did cleave fountains and torrents; you dried up mighty rivers.
16. The day is your, and the night is your; you have prepared the sun and the moon.
17. You have made all the borders of the earth; you have made summer and spring.
18. Remember this your creation: an enemy has reproached the Lord, and a foolish people has provoked your name.
19. Deliver not to the wild beasts a soul that gives praise to you: forget not for ever the souls of your poor.
20. Look upon your covenant: for the dark places of the earth are filled with the habitations of iniquity.
21. let not the afflicted and shamed one be rejected: the poor and needy shall praise your name.
22. Arise, O God, plead your cause: remember your reproaches that come from the foolish one all the day.
23. Forget not the voice of your suppliants: let the pride of them that hate you continually ascend before you.

6. For good comes neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert mountains.
7. For God is the judge; he puts down one, and raises up another.
8. For there is a cup in the hand of the Lord, full of unmingled wine; and he has turned it from side to side, but its dregs have not been wholly poured out; all the sinners of the earth shall drink them.

4. All my enemies set a watch against me: I was troubled, and spoke not.
5. I considered the days of old, and remembered ancient years.
6. And I meditated; I communed with my heart by night, and diligently searched my spirit, saying,
7. Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be well pleased no more?
8. Will he cut off his mercy for ever, even for ever and ever?
9. Will God forget to pity? or will he shut up his compassions in his wrath? Pause.

1. Give heed, O my people, to my law: incline your ear to the words of my mouth.
2 . I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter dark sayings which have been from the beginning.
3. All which we have heard and known, and our fathers have declared to us.
4. They were not hid from their children to a second generations; the fathers declaring the praises of the Lord, and his mighty acts, and his wonders which he wrought.
5. And he raised up a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, to make it known to their children:
6. that another generation might know, even the sons which should be born; and they should arise and declare them to their children.
7. That they might set their hope on God, and not forget the works of God, but diligently seek his commandments.
8. That they should not be as their fathers, a perverse and provoking generation; a generation which set not its heart aright, and its spirit was not steadfast with God.
9. The children of Ephraim, bending and shooting with the bow, turned back in the day of battle.
10. They kept not the covenant of God, and would not walk in his law.
11. And they forgot his benefits, and his miracles which he had showed them;
12. the miracles which he wrought before their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Tanes.
13. He clave the sea, and led them through: he made the waters to stand as in a bottle.
14. And he guided them with a cloud by day, and all the night with a light of fire.
15. he clave a rock in the wilderness, and made them drink as in a great deep.
16. And he brought water out of the rock, and caused waters to flow down as rivers.
17. And they sinned yet more against him; they provoked the Most High in the wilderness.
18. And they tempted God in their hearts, in asking meat for the desire of their souls.
19. They spoke also against God, and said, Will God be able to prepare a table in the wilderness?
20. Forasmuch as he struck the rock, and the waters flowed, and the torrents ran abundantly; will he be able also to give bread, or prepare a table for his people?
21. Therefore the Lord heard, and was provoked: and fire was kindled in Jacob, and wrath went up against Israel.
22. Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation.
23. Yet he commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
24. and rained upon them manna to eat, and gave them the bread of heaven.
25. Man ate angels' bread; he sent them provision to the full.
26. He removed the south wind from heaven; and by his might he brought in the southwest wind.
27. And he rained upon them flesh like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the seas.
28. And they fell into the midst of their camp, round about their tents.
29. So they ate, and were completely filled; and he gave them their desire.
30. They were not disappointed of their desire: but when their food was yet in their mouth,
31. then the indignation of God rose up against them, and killed the fattest of them, and overthrew the choice men of Israel.
32. In the midst of all this they sinned yet more, and believed not his miracles.
33. And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years with anxiety.
34. When he killed them, they sought him: and they returned and called betimes upon God.
35. And they remembered that God was their helper, and the most high God was their redeemer.
36. Yet they loved him only with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.
37. For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.
38. But he is compassionate, and will forgive their sins, and will not destroy them: yes, he will frequently turn away his wrath, and will not kindle all his anger.
39. And he remembered that they are flesh; a wind that passes away, and returns not.
40. How often did they provoke him in the wilderness, and anger him in a dry land!
41. Yes, they turned back, and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
42. They remembered not his hand, the day in which he delivered them from the hand of the oppressor.
43. How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanes:
44. and had changed their rivers into blood; and their streams, that they should not drink.
45. He sent against them the dog-fly, and it devoured them; and the frog, and it spoiled them.
46. And he gave their fruit to the canker worm, and their labors to the locust.
47. He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost.
48. And he gave up their cattle to hail, and their substance to the fire.
49. He sent out against them the fury of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and affliction, a message by evil angels.
50. He made a way for his wrath; he spared not their souls from death, but consigned their cattle to death;
51. and struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt; the first fruits of their labors in the tents of Cham.
52. And he removed his people like sheep; he led them as a flock in the wilderness.
53. And he guided them with hope, and they feared not: but the sea covered their enemies.
54. And he brought them in to the mountain of his sanctuary, this mountain which his right hand had purchased.
55. And he cast out the nations from before them, and made them to inherit by a line of inheritance, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
56. Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies.
57. And they turned back, and broke covenant, even as also their fathers: they became like a crooked bow.
58. And they provoked him with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
59. God heard and lightly regarded them, and greatly despised Israel.
60. And he rejected the tabernacle of Selom, his tent where he lived among men.
61. And he gave their strength into captivity, and their beauty into the enemy's hand.
62. And he gave his people to the sword; and disdained his inheritance.
63. Fire devoured their young men; and their virgins mourned not.
64. Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows shall not be wept for.
65. So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and as a mighty man who has been heated with wine.
66. And he struck his enemies in the hinder parts: he brought on them a perpetual reproach.
67. And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
68. but chose the tribe of Juda, the mount Sion which he loved.
69. And he built his sanctuary as the place of unicorns; he founded it for ever on the earth.
70. He chose David also his servant, and took him up from the flocks of sheep.
71. He took him from following the ewes great with young, to be the shepherd of Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance.
72. So he tended them in the innocency of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

3. For my soul is filled with troubles, and my life has drawn near to Hades.
4. I have been reckoned with them that go down to the pit; I became as a man without help;
5. free among the dead, as the slain ones cast out, who sleep in the tomb; whom you remember no more; and they are rejected from your hand.
6. They laid me in the lowest pit, in dark places, and in the shadow of death.
7. Your wrath has pressed heavily upon me, and you have brought upon me all your billows. Pause.
8. You have removed my acquaintance far from me; they have made me an abomination to themselves; I have been delivered up, and have not gone forth.
9. Mine eyes are dimmed from poverty; but I cried to you, O Lord, all the day; I spread forth my hands to you.
10. Will you work wonders for the dead? or shall physicians raise them up, that they shall praise you?
11. Shall any one declare your mercy in the tomb? and your truth in destruction?
12. Shall your wonders be known in darkness? and your righteousness in a forgotten land?
13. But I cried to you, O Lord; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent you.
14. Therefore, O Lord, do you reject my prayer, and turn your face away from me?
15. I am poor and in troubles from my youth; and having been exalted, I was brought low and into despair.
16. Your wrath has passed over me; and your terrors have greatly disquieted me.
17. They compassed me like water; all the day they beset me together.
18. You have put far from me every friend, and my acquaintances because of my wretchedness.

38. But you have cast off and set at nothing, you have rejected your anointed.
39. You have overthrown the covenant of your servant; you have profaned his sanctuary, casting it to the ground.
40. You have broken down all his hedges; you have made his strong holds a terror.
41. All that go by the way have spoiled him: he is become a reproach to his neighbors.
42. You have exalted the right hand of his enemies; you have made all his enemies to rejoice.
43. You have turned back the help of his sword, and have not helped him in the battle.
44. You have deprived him of glory: you have broken down his throne to the ground.
45. You have shortened the days of his throne: you have poured shame upon him. Pause.
46. How long, O Lord, will you turn away, for ever? shall your anger flame out as fire?
47. Remember what my being is: for have you created all the sons of men in vain?
48. What man is there who shall live, and not see death? shall any one deliver his soul from the hand of Hades? Pause.
49. Where are your ancient mercies, O Lord, which you sware to David in your truth?
50. Remember, O Lord, the reproach of your servants, which I have borne in my bosom, even the reproach of many nations;
51. wherewith your enemies have reviled, O Lord: wherewith they have reviled the recompense of your anointed.

 O God, pass not over my praise in silence;
2. for the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the crafty man have been opened against me: they have spoken against me with a crafty tongue.
3. And they have compassed me with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
4 . Instead of loving me, they falsely accused me: but I continued to pray.
5. And they rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

17. He loved cursing also, and it shall come upon him; and he took not pleasure in blessing, so it shall be removed far from him.
18. Yes, he put on cursing as a garment, and it is come as water into his bowels, and as oil into his bones.
19. Let it be to him as a garment which he puts on, and as a girdle with which he girds himself continually.

21. But you, O Lord, Lord, deal mercifully with me, for your name's sake: for your mercy is good.
22. Deliver me, for I am poor and needy; and my heart is troubled within me.
23. I am removed as a shadow in its going down: I am tossed up and down like locusts.
24. My knees are weakened through fasting, and my flesh is changed by reason of the lack of oil.

27. And let them know that this is your hand; and that you, Lord, have wrought it.
28. Let them curse, but you shall bless: let them that rise up against me be ashamed, but let your servant rejoice.
