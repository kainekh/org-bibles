#+TITLE: Bible Version Information

The texts here are taken from the [[WEB][https://worldenglishbible.org]]. 

All footnotes, cross-references, prefaces, front-matter, and back-matter have been removed.

Versification is kept as far as I can keep it. The translation text has not been altered.

Books in the traditional canons are not removed and are interspersed according to the Greek ordering the texts. In the case of Esther, the WEB version is kept alongside the traditional text since it is so different. Daniel is present only in the traditional form.

The World English Bible text is in the public domain but not the name WEB.
